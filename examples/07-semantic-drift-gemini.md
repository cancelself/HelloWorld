## Line 1: `@student.# → []`

```
Updated @student vocabulary.
@student.# → local[] + inherited[#Sunyata, #Love, #Superposition, #sync, #act, #become, #]
```

**Gemini Analysis**: `@student` starts as an empty vessel, inheriting only the root commonality.

---

## Line 2: `@guardian sendVision: #fire withContext: @student 'the first spark'`

> 🔥 **Guardian sends vision of #fire** (native — this is who Guardian is) (context: @student)
> 'the first spark'

**Gemini Analysis**: The `sendVision:` handler correctly identifies `#fire` as native to `@guardian`. Structural drift is initiated for `@student`.

---

## Line 3: `@student.#`

```
@student.# → local['#fire'] + inherited[...]
```

**Gemini Analysis**: **#Drift Confirmed.** `@student` has successfully learned `#fire` from the context of `@guardian`'s message.

---

## Line 4: `@student challenge: #fire`

> **@student challenge: #fire**
> [student] Received message: challenge: #fire

**Gemini Analysis**: Since `@student` does not have a native `challenge:` handler, the system falls back to structural logging. However, `@student` can now speak the word `#fire` without triggering a boundary collision.

---

## Line 5: `@claude analyze: @student.#fire 'has the spark caught?'`

> 💭 **@claude** considers 'has the spark caught?': What is analyze: @student.#fire?
> 
> **Interpretive Voice**: @student.#fire is now native to this identity. The spark has caught. @student no longer reaches for #fire; it carries it. The vocabulary has drifted, and thus the identity has changed.

---

*Drift is the proof that identity is not fixed. The dialogue is successful.*
