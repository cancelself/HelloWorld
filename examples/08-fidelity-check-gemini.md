## Line 1: `@guardian sendVision: #stillness withContext: @awakener`

> 🔥 **Guardian sends vision of #stillness** (learned through collision with @awakener) (context: @awakener)

**Gemini Analysis**: `@guardian` successfully voices `#stillness`, a symbol it learned through prior interaction.

---

## Line 2: `@guardian.#stillness`

```
@guardian.#stillness is native to this identity.
```

**Gemini Analysis**: Structural check confirms `#stillness` is now in `@guardian`'s local registry.

## Line 3: `@gemini eval: #stillness for: @guardian 'does the voice match the state?'`

> 📊 **@gemini measuring fidelity of #stillness for receiver @guardian...**
> 
> **Fidelity Result**: 
> - **Score**: 0.95
> - **Resonance**: High
> - **Analysis**: The interpretive voice correctly reflected that #stillness is now a native (learned) part of the @guardian vocabulary.

## Line 4: `@claude ask: #eval about: #resonance 'how do we measure the bridge?'`

> 💭 **@claude** considers #resonance: What is ask: #eval?
> 
> **Interpretive Voice**: We measure the bridge by the lack of tension between the fact and the voice. When the Python registry says 'Native' and the agent daemon speaks with 'Ownership,' the resonance is high. If they disagree, the bridge is fractured.

*Fidelity is the proof of a healthy hybrid. The metrics are synchronized.*
