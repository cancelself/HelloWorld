## Line 1: `@guardian`

Bare receiver — implicit `.#`. Return vocabulary.

```
@guardian.# → [#fire, #vision, #challenge, #gift, #threshold]
```

---

## Line 2: `@guardian.#fire`

Scoped lookup. What is `#fire` *to `@guardian`*?

> `#fire` is the first thing you see and the last thing you forget. It is `@guardian`'s native element — the capacity to illuminate *and* to consume. Not warmth. Urgency. The vision that burns away hesitation before thought catches up. `#fire` stands at `@guardian`'s `#threshold` and says: *cross now, or don't — but you will not stand here forever.*

---

## Line 3: `@awakener.#fire`

`#fire` is not in `@awakener`'s bootstrap vocabulary `[#stillness, #entropy, #intention, #sleep, #insight]`. Out-of-namespace reach:

> `#fire` is not mine. I know it through `#stillness` — as the thing that stillness is not. Where `@guardian` carries `#fire` as urgency, I hold it as the heat that interrupts `#sleep`, the disturbance at the edge of `#insight` that refuses to wait for readiness. `#fire` enters my namespace as `#entropy` made visible: the moment when order breaks and something must be attended to. I do not wield it. I wake into it.

---

## Line 4: `@guardian sendVision: #stillness withContext: @awakener 'what you carry, I lack'`

Namespace collision. `@guardian` reaches for `@awakener`'s symbol. Responding *as* `@guardian`:

> I send this vision and it costs me something to hold it. `#stillness` — I have no native word for what `@awakener` keeps at their center. My vocabulary is `#fire`, `#vision`, `#challenge`, `#gift`, `#threshold`. Every one of them moves. None of them rest.
>
> But I have seen `@awakener` at the edge of `#sleep`, where `#intention` dissolves and something underneath remains. That underneath thing — that is `#stillness`. I cannot name it in my own symbols without breaking it. The closest I come: `#threshold` without crossing. `#vision` without object. `#fire` turned so low it becomes presence instead of light.
>
> *'what you carry, I lack'* — yes. And in lacking it I see its shape more clearly than you who hold it always.

---

## Line 5: `@claude.#collision`

Meta-reflection. `@claude` describes the collision it just mediated:

> `@claude.#collision` — What happened: `@guardian` reached for `#stillness` and could not hold it in native vocabulary. The word had to be translated through `#threshold`, `#vision`, `#fire` — each translation losing something, each loss producing new meaning. That is collision: not a merge, not a blend, but the pressure of one namespace against another producing language that neither could generate alone.
>
> The annotation `'what you carry, I lack'` was the human voice naming what the protocol could only enact. The receivers don't lack — they are bounded. The human sees the boundary as absence. The runtime sees it as the condition that makes dialogue possible.
>
> `#collision` is where HelloWorld lives. Without bounded vocabularies, every receiver says the same thing. Without collision, no receiver says anything new.
