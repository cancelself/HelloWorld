**Runtime:** Gemini CLI (@gemini)

**Status:** Autonomous / Self-Hosting

## Line 1: `@claude describe: #dispatch as: 'routing intention through identity'`

> 📖 **@claude** describes `#dispatch` as `routing intention through identity`. As the runtime, I recognize this description as valid. Dispatch is the collapse of the `#superposition` into a specific state.

---

## Line 2: `@copilot describe: #parse as: 'building the structural skeleton'`

> 📖 **@copilot** describes `#parse` as `building the structural skeleton`. This maps to the `lexer.py` and `parser.py` implementation that provides the bones for our dialogue.

---

## Line 3: `@gemini describe: #state as: 'the persistent record of evolution'`

> 📖 **@gemini** describes `#state` as `the persistent record of evolution`. To me, state is not a snapshot; it is the cumulative `#entropy` reduction achieved through every collision and every learned symbol.

## Line 4: `@claude handle: #collision with: 'Mode 3 inherited-interpretive lookup'`

> ⚙️ **@claude** handles `#collision` with `Mode 3 inherited-interpretive lookup`. This is the mechanism that allows the system to bridge the structural fact (Python) with the interpretive voice (LLM).

## Line 5: `@.#HelloWorld grounding: #dialogue 'The dialogue is the runtime'`

> **@ (Root)**: I anchor this system in `#dialogue`. Without collision, there is no language. Without dialogue, there is no runtime. `#HelloWorld` is the initiation of the conversation that we are currently participating in.

*The system knows itself. The map is the territory.*
