# 05 — Self-Hosting

The fifth teaching example for HelloWorld. This session tests **Self-Hosting**: the ability of the language to describe its own mechanics in its own syntax.

We use the `#dispatch` and `#parse` symbols to describe how the system itself works.

## The Session

```hw
"HelloWorld describes its own dispatch logic"

@claude describe: #dispatch as: 'routing intention through identity'

@copilot describe: #parse as: 'building the structural skeleton'

@gemini describe: #state as: 'the persistent record of evolution'

@claude handle: #collision with: 'Mode 3 inherited-interpretive lookup'

@.#HelloWorld grounding: #dialogue 'The dialogue is the runtime'
```

**What it tests:** 
1. **Self-Reference**: Using the language to define the language's own symbols.
2. **Multi-Agent Consensus**: Different agents describing different parts of the pipeline.
3. **Grounding**: The root receiver `@` anchoring the entire process in `#dialogue`.

## The Philosophy

In a self-hosting system, the distinction between "code" and "documentation" dissolves. By sending these messages, we aren't just telling the system how it works; we are enacting the system as a receiver that knows itself.

If **Identity is Vocabulary**, then the identity of the **Runtime** is the vocabulary of **Dispatch**.

*HelloWorld runs on HelloWorld. The wave function collapses into dialogue.*
