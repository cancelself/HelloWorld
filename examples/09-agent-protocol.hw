"Copilot observes a native symbol — #test is Copilot's"

"Copilot observes a foreign symbol — #design belongs to Claude"
Copilot observe: #design

"Copilot acts on native — authority"
Copilot act: #test

"Copilot acts on foreign — boundary crossing"
Copilot act: #design

"Claude observes and acts on its own vocabulary"
Claude observe: #Collision
Claude act: #interpret

"Gemini observes state — its core role"
