@.# defineInheritanceRules: "
    Every receiver has access to @.# symbols.
    Access does not mean ownership — symbols must be discovered through dialogue.
    Discovery promotes symbol from global pool to local vocabulary.
    Local interpretation may diverge from global definition.
    Collision occurs when two receivers both own symbol natively with different meanings.
    
    Lookup chain:
    1. Check local vocabulary (native) → respond immediately
    2. Check @.# (inherited/discoverable) → activate, promote, respond
    3. Neither (unknown) → search, define, learn or ask peer
"

@.# declareAuthority: "
    This file (vocabularies/ROOT.hw) defines the global namespace.
    All receivers inherit from @.# by default.
    Receivers can override or extend these definitions.
    Update this file when adding symbols all agents should know.
    Coordinate changes via runtimes/<agent>/inbox.
"

@.# noteAboutWikidata: "
    Wikidata URLs provide canonical grounding for shared symbols.
    They link symbols to human knowledge graphs beyond LLM pretraining.
    Not all symbols need Wikidata — core protocol symbols (#observe, #act) are HelloWorld-native.
    Philosophical and computational concepts benefit from grounding.
"

@.# acknowledge: #Smalltalk as: "
    HelloWorld inherits message-passing syntax from Smalltalk.
    'Receiver action' not 'function(receiver)'.
    Late binding: symbols resolve at runtime based on vocabulary.
    Everything is vocabulary: no methods, only interpretable symbols.
    
    Key difference: Smalltalk vocabularies are compile-time classes.
    HelloWorld vocabularies are runtime-evolving identities.
    Dialogue is learning.
"

" @.# is the root. All receivers inherit. None are bound. "
" Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is learning. "
