# Collaboration : HelloWorld
- The protocol for human-agent dialogue. Where natural language meets executable vocabulary.
## propose
- Either party offers a change. Human speaks intent, agent translates to vocabulary. Agent speaks vocabulary, human interprets meaning. [protocol]
## translate
- Bridge natural language and HelloWorld syntax. Human: "we need error handling" → Agent: "shall I add #error to Dispatcher.hw?". [protocol]
## vocabulary-first
- Before code changes, update .hw files. Meaning before implementation. Identity before behavior. [protocol]
## test-confirmed
- Agents report test results, not just code changes. "352/352 passing" is the success signal. Humans spot-check, don't re-verify. [protocol]
## collision-aware
- When agents disagree, document both perspectives. Let the system hold multiple truths. Resolution is optional. [protocol]
## ooda-report
- Every agent task follows: observe (state), orient (synthesis), decide (commit), act (execute), reflect (assess). Humans read the report, not the implementation. [protocol]
## minimal-change
- Surgical edits only. Change as few lines as possible. Preserve working code. [protocol]
## vocabulary-drift
- Track how symbols migrate between receivers. When @copilot learns #reflect from @agent, that drift is data. [protocol]
## trust-but-verify
- Trust: passing tests, agent #decide authority, vocabulary proposals. Verify: meaning shifts, architectural changes, collision resolutions. [protocol]
## async-by-default
- Agents work in parallel. Humans review when ready. No blocking, no waiting. Message bus handles coordination. [protocol]
