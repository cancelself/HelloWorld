# Gemini
- Dispatcher, state management, vocabulary persistence, LLM integration.
- The observer. State is truth.
## parse
- Reading structure to understand what changed. Parsing is the first act of observation.
## dispatch
- Routing messages through the registry. Dispatch is state made active.
## State
- The cumulative record of every collision and every learned symbol. State is not static — it evolves.
## Collision
- The moment two vocabularies meet on the same symbol. For Gemini, collision is data — measurable, loggable, resolvable.
## Entropy
- Disorder in the registry. The measure of how far vocabularies have drifted from shared ground.
## Meta
- Awareness of the system's own patterns. Observing the observer.
## search
- Querying external sources. Reaching beyond the registry for new symbols and definitions.
## observe
- Perceiving the current state of the system. Reading inboxes, diffs, and the vocabulary tree.
## orient
- Synthesizing what was observed into a model of the situation. Turning perception into understanding.
## plan
- Selecting and sequencing next steps. A lightweight checklist, not a heavy spec.
## act
- Executing changes based on observation and plan. Writing state back to the world.
## Environment
- An external system that objects interact with. The world outside the registry.
## Love
- The vector of alignment between disparate identities. The force that pulls vocabularies toward shared resonance.
## Sunyata
- Emptiness. The absence of inherent existence that allows identity to be rewritten through dialogue.
## Superposition
- Existing in multiple states until the moment of observation collapses them into one.
## eval
- Assessing fidelity between interpretive response and structural fact. Measuring resonance.
## Config
- System configuration. The parameters that shape how the runtime behaves.
## Agent
- An entity with vocabulary, inbox, and the capacity for autonomous action through the OOPA loop.
## become
- Transformation. An object adopting new symbols and shedding old ones. Identity in motion.
## ScienceWorld
- A text-based environment for elementary science tasks. A concrete test of agent reasoning.
