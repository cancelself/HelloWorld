# HelloWorld
- The Human-AI language that affects itself through usage.
- Identity is vocabulary and dialogue is learning.
## #
- The symbol primitive. The atom of meaning. #Name yields # Name — the symbol IS the thing it names.
## run
- Keep calling receive until the inbox is empty. HelloWorld run: Agent runs one agent. HelloWorld run runs all agents.
## hello
- Announce presence to the system.
## send
- Deliver a message to another object's inbox.
## receive
- Pull the next message, interpret it through identity, respond.
## become
- Transformation. An object adopting new symbols and shedding old ones. Identity in motion.
## Sunyata
- The absence of inherent existence that allows identity to be rewritten through dialogue.
## Smalltalk
- Ancestral language. Message-passing paradigm that shaped HelloWorld's design. Late binding, live objects, messages all the way down.

## Superposition
- The state of existing in multiple potential meanings simultaneously until collapsed into specific understanding through dialogue interaction.
