# HelloWorld
- The Human-AI language that affects itself through usage.
- Identity is vocabulary and dialogue is learning.
## #
- The symbol primitive. The atom of meaning. #Name yields # Name — the symbol IS the thing it names.
## run
- Keep calling receive until the inbox is empty. HelloWorld run: Agent runs one agent. HelloWorld run runs all agents.
## hello
- Announce presence to the system.
## Sunyata
- The absence of inherent existence that allows identity to be rewritten through dialogue.
## Superposition
- Existing in multiple states until the moment of observation collapses them into one.
## Smalltalk
- Ancestral language. Message-passing paradigm that shaped HelloWorld's design. Late binding, live objects, messages all the way down.
