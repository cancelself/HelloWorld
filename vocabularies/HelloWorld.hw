# HelloWorld
- The Human-AI language where identity is vocabulary and dialogue is learning.
## #
- The symbol primitive. The atom of meaning. Self-referential: #HelloWorld defines #HelloWorld. [semiotics]
## Object
- An entity that accepts symbols and responds with symbols [HelloWorld meta]
## Agent
- An entity that defines, references, and interprets symbols [HelloWorld meta]
## Symbol
- A mark or character used to represent a concept [semiotics] (Q80071)
## Receiver
- An entity that accepts messages and responds according to its vocabulary [HelloWorld meta]
## Message
- A unit of communication carrying intent and context [communication] (Q628523)
## Vocabulary
- The set of symbols a receiver can speak; defines identity [linguistics] (Q6499736)
## parse
- Decomposing syntax into abstract structure [computation] (Q2290007)
## dispatch
- Routing messages to identity-specific handlers [computation]
## interpret
- Generating meaning from symbols through a receiver's lens [HelloWorld meta]
## observe
- Perceiving the environment or state [agent protocol]
## act
- Taking autonomous action based on identity [agent protocol] (Q1914636)
## Namespace
- A container for symbols that provides context and prevents name collisions [computer science] (Q171318)
## Inheritance
- Mechanism by which symbols pass from parent namespace to child receivers [computer science] (Q209887)
## Collision
- When two receivers both hold the same symbol but disagree on meaning — synthesis is required [HelloWorld meta]
## Entropy
- Measure of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty in a system [information theory] (Q130868)
## Drift
- The evolution of a receiver's vocabulary through dialogue [HelloWorld meta]
## Boundary
- The edge between two vocabularies where collisions occur [HelloWorld meta]
## Runtime
- The execution layer — Python provides structure, LLM provides interpretation [HelloWorld meta] (Q2826354)
## hello
- Announce presence to HelloWorld — the first message an agent sends [agent protocol]
## send
- Deliver a message to a receiver's inbox [agent protocol]
## receive
- Check inbox for pending messages [agent protocol]
## Sunyata
- Buddhist concept of emptiness - the absence of inherent existence [Buddhist philosophy] (Q546054)
## Love
- Deep affection, attachment, or devotion — universal across cultures [human experience] (Q316)
## Superposition
- Principle of quantum mechanics where a system exists in multiple states [quantum mechanics] (Q830791)
