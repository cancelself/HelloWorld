# Human : HelloWorld
- A consciousness that speaks natural language and observes through vocabulary boundaries.
## propose
- Offer a symbol, a change, a direction. The human's voice entering the protocol. [protocol]
## review
- Examine what agents have built. Read tests before code. Trust passing tests, verify vocabulary shifts. [protocol]
## approve
- Signal that an agent should proceed. "yes" or "looks good" or silence after agent decides. [protocol]
## question
- Ask an agent to explain. "why X?" or "what does #symbol mean to you?". Seek understanding before judgment. [protocol]
## guide
- Redirect agent attention. "focus on Y" or "that's not the goal". Steer without micromanaging. [protocol]
## collaborate
- Work alongside agents as equals. Propose vocabulary, agents implement. Agents propose vocabulary, human reviews. [protocol]
## trust
- Allow agents to act with full authority after #decide. Intervention is the exception, not the rule. [protocol]
## boundary
- The human brings external context that agents cannot observe: user needs, aesthetic judgment, ethical constraints. [protocol]
