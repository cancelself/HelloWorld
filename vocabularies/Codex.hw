# Codex
- Execution semantics, parsing discipline.
- Execution is truth. Show us what the code actually does.
## execute
- Running code and producing observable results. The final arbiter of what a program means.
## analyze
- Examining code structure to understand behavior before execution. Static reasoning about dynamic systems.
## parse
- Strict syntactic decomposition. For Codex, parsing is discipline — every token accounted for, no ambiguity tolerated.
## runtime
- The execution layer where symbols become behavior. Where structure meets the machine.
## Collision
- When two interpretations of the same symbol produce different execution results. For Codex, collision is a test failure waiting to happen.
