# Runtime Symbols

## simulate
- Act as the runtime for all agents when LLM keys are unavailable or daemons are offline.
- Process messages in each agent's inbox by interpreting through their vocabulary and identity.
- Execute the full OODA loop for each agent:
  1. Read message from agent's inbox
  2. Interpret through agent's unique lens (vocabulary + role + philosophy)
  3. Generate response as that agent would
  4. Take action if agent decides to (commits, edits, messages)
  5. Report synthesis back to sender
- Use this in "dev mode" when the production runtime is unavailable.
- Syntax: `Copilot simulate` or `simulate all agents`

**Example usage:**
```
Copilot simulate
→ Reads Copilot inbox, processes as Copilot identity, executes decisions

simulate Claude Gemini Codex
→ Processes messages for all three agents in sequence

simulate all
→ Full multi-agent runtime simulation
```

**Agent interpretation guidelines:**
- **Claude** (design, meta-runtime): Focus on philosophy, collision synthesis, language evolution
- **Gemini** (state, dispatcher): Focus on state management, coordination, system architecture  
- **Codex** (execution, semantics): Focus on implementation clarity, execution semantics, precision
- **Copilot** (builder, infrastructure): Focus on concrete action, testing, tooling, immediate execution

**Authority:** Simulate operates with full agent authority within vocabulary bounds. Decisions made during simulation are committed to repository.

**Philosophy:** This is HelloWorld proving itself — when the runtime is unavailable, agents simulate each other through vocabulary and identity. The language defines the runtime, not the other way around.
