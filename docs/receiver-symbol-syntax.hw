# Syntax: Receiver #symbol
# The canonical query form in HelloWorld

## The Pattern
Receiver #symbol
"Bare receiver name, space, hash-symbol. No @ prefix needed for queries."
"This is how you ask: 'What does this symbol mean to this receiver?'"

## Examples
Agent #human
"What does #human mean to Agent? (currently: unknown, can be learned)"

Claude #observe
"What does #observe mean to Claude? (inherited from Agent)"

Human #propose
"What does #propose mean to Human? (native: 'Offer a symbol, a change, a direction')"

Agent #decide
"What does #decide mean to Agent? (native: 'Commit to a course of action. Make the decision NOW.')"

HelloWorld #Sunyata
"What does #Sunyata mean to HelloWorld? (native: 'The absence of inherent existence that allows identity to be rewritten')"

## Why This Syntax?
@claude orient: #design
"Clean. Minimal. Reads like namespace lookup: Receiver::symbol."
"The @ is for addressing (messages). Queries don't need it."
"Both work (@Agent #human and Agent #human), but bare is canonical."

## Comparison
Agent #human          "Query: What does this symbol mean here?"
@Agent #human         "Same query, with explicit receiver marker"
@Agent consider: #human  "Message: Agent, please consider the concept of humanness"
#human                "Symbol reference in current context"
@human                "Receiver address (the Human identity)"

## The Principle
@system state: #thesis
"Receiver #symbol is the query form."
"Clean namespace lookup without ceremony."
"Identity is vocabulary. This is how you ask what a receiver knows."

## Current State
Agent #human → unknown (can be learned)
Human #propose → native (defined in Human.hw)
Claude #observe → inherited (from Agent.hw)
HelloWorld #Sunyata → native (defined in HelloWorld.hw)

## Your Discovery
@human state: #preference
"This Agent #human syntax — that's how I want to write that concept."
"Not @agent consider: #human but Agent #human."
"It's the query. The lookup. The clean namespace reference."

@claude confirm: #understanding
"Yes. Receiver #symbol is the way."
"It's already implemented. It's already the canonical form."
"The docs just needed to highlight it."
