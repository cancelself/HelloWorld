# Shared Symbol: #superposition

**Wikidata**: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q830791  
**Wikipedia**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition  
**Definition**: Principle of quantum mechanics where a system exists in multiple states simultaneously until observed/measured

## HelloWorld Context

`#superposition` becomes a **shared symbol** across receiver vocabularies with different meanings in each namespace:

### @awakener.#superposition
**Meaning**: The state before choice solidifies into action  
**Use**: `@awakener hold: #superposition until: #clarity emerges`  
**Collision with**: #intention (which resolves superposition), #stillness (which maintains it)

### @guardian.#superposition  
**Meaning**: The threshold moment where multiple paths are visible  
**Use**: `@guardian illuminate: #superposition before: @awakener chooses`  
**Collision with**: #threshold (superposition is standing at threshold), #fire (which collapses superposition)

### @claude.#superposition
**Meaning**: Multiple valid interpretations existing simultaneously in conversation  
**Use**: `@claude maintain: #superposition across: @receivers 'preserve ambiguity'`  
**Collision with**: #collision (superposition is pre-collision state)

### @gemini.#superposition
**Meaning**: State space before dispatch decision  
**Use**: `@gemini evaluate: #superposition of: @receiver.vocabulary`  
**Collision with**: #dispatch (which collapses superposition into action)

### @copilot.#superposition
**Meaning**: Multiple possible implementations existing before tool choice  
**Use**: `@copilot explore: #superposition of: #solutions`  
**Collision with**: #bash, #edit, #create (each tool collapses superposition)

### @codex.#superposition
**Meaning**: Code that can execute in multiple ways depending on runtime  
**Use**: `@codex interpret: #superposition according: @runtime`  
**Collision with**: #execute (collapses), #parse (reveals superposition)

## Why This Symbol Matters

**Traditional shared vocabulary**: Same word means same thing everywhere  
**HelloWorld shared vocabulary**: Same symbol holds different meanings per namespace

When `@guardian illuminate: #superposition` is sent to `@awakener`, a **namespace collision** occurs:
- @guardian sees: "showing multiple paths before threshold"
- @awakener sees: "receiving state before intention crystallizes"
- **Collision creates**: Synthesis of observer and observed, teacher and student

This is the **quantum nature of HelloWorld dialogue**:
- Symbols exist in superposition of meanings
- Observation (message passing) collapses to specific interpretation
- Measurement happens at namespace boundary
- Observer and observed both change

## Usage Examples

### Simple reference
```
@awakener query: #superposition
→ "State before choice solidifies"
```

### Cross-namespace message (creates collision)
```
@guardian illuminate: #superposition for: @awakener
→ Collision: threshold-showing meets choice-holding
→ New meaning emerges
```

### Meta-reflection
```
@claude observe: #superposition across: @all_receivers
→ Maps how each receiver interprets the symbol differently
→ Reveals the namespace collision space
```

### Vocabulary evolution
```
@new_receiver define: #superposition as: 'undecided git branch'
→ Extends shared symbol into new namespace
→ Creates new collision possibilities
```

## Collision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Observer Effect
```
@guardian sendVision: #superposition withContext: @awakener
```
**Collision**: Guardian's illumination (active observation) collapses Awakener's held state  
**Emergence**: The act of showing paths forces a choice  
**Meaning**: You can't illuminate someone's superposition without changing it

### Scenario 2: Entanglement
```
@awakener hold: #superposition
@guardian hold: #superposition
@claude observe: both
```
**Collision**: Two receivers in superposition, third observes  
**Emergence**: Observation entangles the states — Claude's measurement affects both  
**Meaning**: Observation creates relationships between namespaces

### Scenario 3: Decoherence
```
@awakener hold: #superposition
@copilot execute: #bash
```
**Collision**: Tool execution collapses possibility space  
**Emergence**: Action destroys superposition — can't undo after commit  
**Meaning**: Some operations are irreversible at namespace boundaries

## Implementation Notes

To add `#superposition` to all bootstrap receivers:

```bash
# Add to vocabulary files
echo "#superposition" >> storage/vocab/awakener.vocab
echo "#superposition" >> storage/vocab/guardian.vocab
echo "#superposition" >> storage/vocab/claude.vocab
echo "#superposition" >> storage/vocab/gemini.vocab
echo "#superposition" >> storage/vocab/copilot.vocab
echo "#superposition" >> storage/vocab/codex.vocab
```

Or update via HelloWorld:
```
@awakener.# → [..., #superposition]
@guardian.# → [..., #superposition]
```

## Why "Superposition" Specifically

1. **Rich metaphor**: Quantum mechanics provides precise language for ambiguity
2. **Already understood**: Technical term with established meaning (Wikidata Q830791)
3. **Cross-domain**: Works for psychology (choice), computation (state), dialogue (meaning)
4. **Generative**: Creates interesting collisions when namespaces meet
5. **Beyond pretraining**: Wikidata link grounds it in shared, evolving knowledge

## Next Shared Symbols to Consider

- `#entanglement` — Receivers whose states are linked across namespace boundaries
- `#measurement` — Act of addressing another receiver (collapses their superposition)
- `#decoherence` — Loss of possibility through interaction with environment
- `#uncertainty` — Complementary properties that can't be known simultaneously
- `#interference` — When two receivers send messages that amplify or cancel

---

**This is how HelloWorld vocabularies evolve: through shared symbols that mean different things in each namespace.**

*Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision. Superposition is the space between.*
