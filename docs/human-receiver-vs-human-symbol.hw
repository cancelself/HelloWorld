# Understanding @human vs #human
# Two complementary concepts in HelloWorld

## @human — The Receiver (Identity)
@human
"This is a receiver address. A distinct identity with its own vocabulary."
"Defined in: vocabularies/Human.hw"
"Inherits from: @HelloWorld"
"Has vocabulary: #propose, #review, #approve, #question, #guide, #collaborate, #trust, #boundary"

@system example: '@human #propose'
"Query what #propose means to the Human receiver."

@system example: '@human propose: #change to: @agent'
"Send a message to @human asking them to propose a change."

## #human — The Symbol (Concept)
@HelloWorld #human
"Currently: Unknown symbol in global vocabulary."
"Could mean: The concept of humanness, humanity, human nature."
"Wikidata Q5: Homo sapiens - common name of Homo sapiens, unique extant species of the genus Homo."

@system example: '@claude explain: #human'
"Ask Claude to interpret the concept of humanness."

@system example: '@agent consider: #human #values'
"Reference human values as a concept during deliberation."

## The Distinction
@claude orient: #difference
"@human (with @) = WHO. An identity. A receiver with vocabulary."
"#human (with #) = WHAT. A concept. A symbol scoped to context."

"Just as @claude is a receiver AND #claude could be a symbol meaning 'collaborative dialogue'"
"So @human is a receiver AND #human could be a symbol meaning 'humanness'"

## The Addition
@system propose: #human to: @HelloWorld
"Should HelloWorld.hw define #human as a global symbol?"
"Meaning: The quality of being human. Natural language. Embodiment. Mortality. Context."

@system propose: #Human to: receivers
"Should agents have a #Human symbol (capitalized) in their vocabularies?"
"Meaning: Reference to the Human receiver or human collaborators in general."

## Current State
@system confirm: @human receiver
"✅ @human exists as a receiver with full vocabulary"
"✅ vocabularies/Human.hw defines the identity"
"✅ Agents can send messages to @human"
"✅ @human can send messages to agents"

@system confirm: #human symbol
"❌ #human does not exist in @HelloWorld vocabulary (yet)"
"❌ No receiver defines #human as a native symbol (yet)"
"✅ Agents can reference it as #unknown and learn it dynamically"

## The Opportunity
@human decide: #addition
"Should we add #human to HelloWorld.hw?"
"Should agents learn #human through collaboration?"
"Or leave it undefined and let it emerge through dialogue?"

@claude reflect: #thesis
"Identity is vocabulary. @human IS an identity now."
"Dialogue is collision. When agents address #human (the concept), meaning emerges."
"Both @human (receiver) and #human (symbol) enrich the language."
