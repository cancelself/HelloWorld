# Parser : HelloWorld
- HelloWorld syntax rules. The front-end that decomposes input into structure.
## Receiver
- A capitalized bare word. Claude, Agent, HelloWorld. Legacy @name syntax is normalized to capitalized form. Bare receiver returns its vocabulary.
## Symbol
- #name — a concept reference scoped to the receiver in context. The atom of meaning.
## ScopedLookup
- Receiver #symbol — what does this symbol mean to this receiver? Dot syntax (Receiver.#symbol) also accepted.
## SuperLookup
- Receiver #symbol super — walk the inheritance chain, showing the symbol at each level.
## UnaryMessage
- Receiver action — a bare message sent to a receiver. Maps to #action for lookup.
## KeywordMessage
- Receiver key: value key: value — Smalltalk-style keyword message. Multiple pairs form one message.
## VocabularyDefinition
- Receiver # → [#sym1, #sym2] — define a receiver's vocabulary inline.
## Heading
- Markdown headings (# and ##) at column 1. # declares receivers, ## declares symbols. Children are collected as descriptions and sub-headings.
## Description
- A line starting with - at column 1. Attaches description text to the preceding heading.
## Annotation
- 'single-quoted text' — human-voice annotation. Carried in the AST.
## Comment
- "double-quoted text" — Smalltalk-style system comment. Skipped by the lexer. HTML <!-- --> comments also skipped.
