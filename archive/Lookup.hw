# Lookup : HelloWorld
- Symbol resolution outcomes. The three-outcome model for what happens when a receiver encounters a symbol.
## native
- The receiver owns this symbol in its local vocabulary. The symbol is part of this identity.
## inherited
- The symbol was found in the receiver's parent chain, not in local vocabulary. Shared ground.
## unknown
- The symbol is not in local vocabulary or parent chain. Truly new. Triggers learning.
## global
- The symbol is defined in @.# (HelloWorld root). The canonical Wikidata definition.
## super
- Walk the inheritance chain to find the symbol's meaning at each level. Layered interpretation.
## collision
- Two receivers both hold the symbol natively but with different meanings. A synthesis event.
