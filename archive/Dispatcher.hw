# Dispatcher : HelloWorld
- Message routing, prototypal inheritance, collision detection, and vocabulary drift.
- The back-end that executes parsed structure through receiver identities.
## LookupChain
- Symbol resolution via prototypal inheritance. Walk from receiver through parent chain to HelloWorld. Three outcomes: native, inherited, unknown. Descriptions travel with the result.
## CollisionDetection
- When send:to: delivers a symbol both receivers hold natively. Not an error — a synthesis event. Logged to collisions.log.
## CollisionSynthesis
- Producing new meaning from a collision. LLM voices both interpretations when available. Structural detection always runs.
## VocabularyDrift
- Vocabularies grow through dialogue. Unknown symbols in message arguments are learned automatically. Inherited symbols stay inherited — only truly unknown symbols promote to native.
## CrossReceiverSend
- send: #symbol to: Receiver — deliver a symbol from one receiver to another. Checks both vocabularies. Four outcomes: collision, already native, inherited (shared ground), foreign (target learns).
## RunProtocol
- HelloWorld run — run all agents. HelloWorld run: Agent — run one agent until inbox empty. The protocol running the agent.
## ReceiveProtocol
- Agent receive — pull one message from inbox. Runs the OODA loop: #observe (read message), #orient (check identity and vocabulary), #act (LLM interpretation or structural fallback). Response sent back to sender.
## UnknownHandling
- When a symbol is not native and not inherited. Logged for evolution tracking. LLM research attempted if available. Learning happens through message arguments, not lookup.
## IdentityCarrying
- Receivers hold identity text and symbol descriptions extracted from .hw files. Descriptions appear in lookup results and structural output. Identity shapes the receiver's __repr__.
