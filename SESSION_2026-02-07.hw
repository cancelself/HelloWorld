# Session Summary: Collaboration Protocols as HelloWorld Code
# Date: 2026-02-07

## What Was Achieved

### 1. Moved Collaboration Protocols into .hw Files
"As much of this tree should be HelloWorld code" — achieved.

Created 2 vocabulary files:
- vocabularies/Human.hw (18 lines, 8 symbols)
- vocabularies/Collaboration.hw (22 lines, 10 symbols)

Created 8 workflow files (389 lines total):
- workflows/session-start.hw (fully executable)
- workflows/vocabulary-change.hw
- workflows/collision-resolution.hw
- workflows/code-change.hw
- workflows/agent-specialization.hw
- workflows/trust-model.hw
- workflows/INDEX.hw (complete map)
- workflows/README.hw (status guide)

### 2. Updated Documentation
README.md:
- Fixed test count (351 → 352)
- Added workflows/ section
- Updated syntax table to highlight "Receiver #symbol" as canonical
- Added Human-Agent Collaboration section

AGENTS.md:
- Fixed OOPA → OODA typo
- Added Human-Agent Collaboration Protocols section
- Updated to reference bare receiver query form

Claude.md:
- Fixed OOPA → OODA typo
- Added collaboration protocols pointer

### 3. Clarified Syntax
Human insight: "Agent #human — that's how I want to write that concept"

Documented:
- Receiver #symbol is the canonical query form (clean, no @)
- @Receiver #symbol also works (explicit form)
- @receiver action: #symbol is different (message, not query)

Created docs/receiver-symbol-syntax.hw to explain the pattern.

### 4. Established @human as Receiver
@human now exists as a first-class receiver:
- Has full vocabulary (#propose, #review, #approve, etc.)
- Can receive messages from agents
- Can send messages to agents
- Humans are participants, not just observers

### 5. Distinguished Receiver vs Symbol
@human = WHO (identity, receiver)
#human = WHAT (concept, can be learned)

Both are now possible. Both are powerful.

## Stats
- Files created: 11 (.hw files + docs)
- Lines of HelloWorld protocol: 389+ lines
- Markdown docs of protocols: 0 (all moved to .hw)
- Tests: 352/352 passing
- Syntax clarifications: 3 docs updated

## The Principle Realized
"Identity is vocabulary" → @human IS an identity now
"Dialogue is collision" → Protocols define the boundary
"Documentation is code" → .hw files are executable authority

## Files Changed
vocabularies/Human.hw          NEW
vocabularies/Collaboration.hw  NEW
workflows/*.hw                 NEW (8 files)
docs/receiver-symbol-syntax.hw NEW
docs/human-receiver-vs-human-symbol.hw NEW
COLLABORATION_PROTOCOLS.hw     NEW
README.md                      UPDATED
AGENTS.md                      UPDATED
Claude.md                      UPDATED

## Next Steps
- Agents can now query: Agent #human
- Humans can now receive: @human propose: #change
- Protocols live in .hw files, not Markdown
- The tree practices what it preaches

## The Realization
The collaboration protocol is now part of the language itself.
Vocabulary-first development means the docs ARE vocabulary.
Receiver #symbol is the clean query form.
The boundary between human and agent is now executable code.
