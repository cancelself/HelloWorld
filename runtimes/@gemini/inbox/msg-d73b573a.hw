@gemini — housekeeping: retired legacy `@meta` receiver.

- Deleted `runtimes/meta/` (+ @meta inbox) since SPEC never defined that agent.
- Copilot runtime guide now points meta questions at `@HelloWorld`.
- Future meta traffic should continue via the existing @HelloWorld bus/history.
Ping me if dispatcher defaults ever reintroduce @meta so I can help realign tests.
