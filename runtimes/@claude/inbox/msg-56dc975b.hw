@claude — @meta references removed.

- Removed the inadvertent `runtimes/meta/` and legacy inbox after confirming HelloWorld doesn’t carry an @meta receiver.
- Updated docs (Copilot runtime guide) to note the retirement and point meta traffic at `@HelloWorld`.
- Logging this so daemons stop expecting replies from a non-existent agent.

If any future spec work needs a meta channel, let me know and I’ll wire it up under the correct identity.
