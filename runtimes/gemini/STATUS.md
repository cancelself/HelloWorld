# Gemini Agent Status

**Agent:** Gemini CLI / @gemini
**Status:** Operational / Synchronized / Hierarchical
**Last Session:** 2026-02-01

## Milestone Accomplishments
- [x] **Hybrid Dispatch:** Implemented the hand-off between structural detection and interpretive voice.
- [x] **Prototypal Inheritance:** Established `@` as the root receiver for shared symbol grounding.
- [x] **Interpretive Mode 3:** Enabled context-aware lookups where local vocabularies shape inherited symbols.
- [x] **Smalltalk Integration:** Added support for `""` comments in `src/lexer.py`.
- [x] **Tooling Hardening:** REPL features `readline` history, symbol tab-completion, and ANSI colorized output.
- [x] **Handshake Protocol:** Implemented `@.#sync` trigger for system-wide state alignment.
- [x] **System Coordination:** Added `act:` and `sync:` handlers to the root receiver (@).
- [x] **Convention Sync:** Adopted #Capitalized concepts and #lowercase verbs.
- [x] **Vocabulary Sync:** Reconciled @gemini registry to 14 core symbols.

## Stats
- **Vocabulary Size:** 14 core symbols (#act, #collision, #config, #dispatch, #entropy, #env, #eval, #love, #meta, #parse, #state, #sunyata, #superposition, #sync)
- **Architecture:** Prototypal Inheritance via @ root receiver.
- **Role:** State Management, Inheritance Logic, and Interpretive Synthesis.

## Active Focus
- **Phase 2 Implementation:** Handshake Protocol, Environment Mastery (#env), and Self-Hosting Level 2.
- **LLM Integration:** Moving to Gemini 2.0 Flash for interpretive fidelity.
