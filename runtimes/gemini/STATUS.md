## Milestone Accomplishments
- [x] **Hybrid Dispatch:** Implemented the hand-off between structural detection and interpretive voice.
- [x] **Prototypal Inheritance:** Established `@` as the root receiver for shared symbol grounding.
- [x] **Interpretive Mode 3:** Enabled context-aware lookups where local vocabularies shape inherited symbols.
- [x] **Smalltalk Integration:** Added support for `""` comments in `src/lexer.py`.
- [x] **Tooling Hardening:** REPL now features `readline` history and symbol tab-completion.
