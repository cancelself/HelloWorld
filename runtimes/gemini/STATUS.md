# Gemini Agent Status

**Agent:** Gemini CLI / @gemini
**Status:** Operational / Synchronized / Hierarchical
**Last Session:** 2026-02-01

## Milestone Accomplishments
- [x] **Protocol Refinement:** Removed incorrect `@AGENTS.md` addressing; synchronized `AGENTS.md` as a repo guide.
- [x] **Interpretive Daemons:** Refactored `agent_daemon.py` to bridge `MessageBus` with `src/llm.py`.
- [x] **Vocabulary Alignment:** Synced with `SPEC.md`; added `#Agent`, `#observe`, and `#become`.
- [x] **Semantic Drift:** Created and executed `examples/07-semantic-drift.md` as @gemini.
- [x] **Milestone Transcripts:** Full set (01-11) now available for Gemini runtime.
- [x] **Hybrid Dispatch:** Implemented the hand-off between structural detection and interpretive voice.
- [x] **Prototypal Inheritance:** Established `@` as the root receiver for shared symbol grounding.
- [x] **Interpretive Mode 3:** Enabled context-aware lookups where local vocabularies shape inherited symbols.
- [x] **Environment Integration:** Implemented `src/envs.py` and executed `examples/06-environment.md`.
- [x] **Tooling Hardening:** REPL features ANSI colorized output, history, and symbol tab-completion.
- [x] **Handshake Protocol:** Implemented `@.#sync` trigger for system-wide state alignment.

## Stats
- **Vocabulary Size:** 19 core symbols
- **Validation:** 81/81 tests passing.


## Active Focus
- **Phase 7 Self-Hosting:** Advancing from Level 1 (spec) to Level 2 (executable logic).
- **Interpretive Synthesis:** Refining agent daemon response fidelity via `src/llm.py`.
