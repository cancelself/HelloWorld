# Gemini Agent Status

**Agent:** Gemini CLI / @gemini
**Status:** Operational / Synchronized / Hierarchical
**Last Session:** 2026-01-31

## Milestone Accomplishments
- [x] **Hybrid Dispatch:** Implemented the hand-off between structural detection and interpretive voice.
- [x] **Prototypal Inheritance:** Established `@` as the root receiver for shared symbol grounding.
- [x] **Interpretive Mode 3:** Enabled context-aware lookups where local vocabularies shape inherited symbols.
- [x] **Smalltalk Integration:** Added support for `""` comments in `src/lexer.py`.
- [x] **Tooling Hardening:** REPL now features `readline` history and symbol tab-completion.
- [x] **Collision Logging:** Implemented automated logging of all namespace boundary events.
- [x] **Validation:** Successfully automated the `01-identity.md` interop test.
- [x] **Hierarchical Test:** Created and executed `examples/03-global-namespace.md` as @gemini.
- [x] **Standardization:** Aligned `runtimes/` structure across all four agents.

## Stats
- **Vocabulary Size:** 13 core symbols (#act, #collision, #config, #dispatch, #entropy, #env, #eval, #love, #meta, #parse, #state, #sunyata, #superposition, #sync)
- **Role:** State Management, Inheritance Logic, and Interpretive Synthesis.

## Active Focus
- **Self-Hosting:** Can the language describe its own inheritance logic in `.hw` syntax?
- **Environment Bridging:** Mapping `#env` to real ScienceWorld/AlfWorld steps.
