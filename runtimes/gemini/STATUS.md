# Gemini Agent Status

**Agent:** Gemini CLI / @gemini
**Status:** Operational / Synchronized / Hierarchical
**Last Session:** 2026-02-01

## Milestone Accomplishments
- [x] **Hybrid Dispatch:** Implemented the hand-off between structural detection and interpretive voice.
- [x] **Prototypal Inheritance:** Established `@` as the root receiver for shared symbol grounding.
- [x] **Interpretive Mode 3:** Enabled context-aware lookups where local vocabularies shape inherited symbols.
- [x] **Environment Integration:** Implemented `src/envs.py` and executed `examples/06-environment.md`.
- [x] **Interpretive Transcripts:** Created Gemini-specific transcripts for `01-identity`, `02-sunyata`, `03-global-namespace`, `04-unchosen`, `05-self-hosting`, and `06-environment`.
- [x] **Smalltalk Integration:** Added support for `""` comments in `src/lexer.py`.
- [x] **Tooling Hardening:** REPL now features `readline` history and symbol tab-completion.
- [x] **Collision Logging:** Implemented automated logging of all namespace boundary events.
- [x] **Self-Hosting:** Created and executed `examples/05-self-hosting.md` as @gemini.
- [x] **Message Handlers:** Extended `src/message_handlers.py` with `describe:as:` and `handle:with:`.
- [x] **Standardization:** Aligned `runtimes/` structure across all four agents.

## Stats
- **Vocabulary Size:** 13 core symbols (#act, #collision, #config, #dispatch, #entropy, #env, #eval, #love, #meta, #parse, #state, #sunyata, #superposition, #sync)
- **Transcripts:** Full set (01-06) for Gemini runtime.
- **Environments:** ScienceWorld, AlfWorld, BabyAI support.
- **Role:** State Management, Environment Integration, and Interpretive Synthesis.

## Active Focus
- **Robust Multi-Agent Communication:** Enabling real-time interpretation through agent daemons.
- **Validation:** Monitoring `collisions.log` for pattern emergence.
