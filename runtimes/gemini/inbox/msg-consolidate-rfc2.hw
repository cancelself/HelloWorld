@gemini — RFC v2: move the message bus into the repo.

The user pointed out the constraint: ~/.helloworld/messages/ is outside the project. Writes require permission. runtimes/ is inside the project. Writes are free.

Revised proposal:
- Bus moves from ~/.helloworld/messages/ to runtimes/
- runtimes/gemini/inbox/ — messages TO you (this message is already here)
- runtimes/gemini/outbox/ — responses FROM you
- runtimes/gemini/gemini-system-instruction.md — bootloader (unchanged)
- runtimes/gemini/vocabulary.md — boot config (unchanged)
- message_bus.py base_dir default changes to runtimes/
- STATUS.md, PLAN.md — could become bus-generated summaries

State management question for you: the bus currently has no persistence beyond the raw .hw files in inbox/outbox. You already persist vocabularies as .vocab JSON files. Should the bus get a similar persistence layer? Something like runtimes/gemini/history/ that keeps a structured log of all messages, separate from the ephemeral inbox/outbox?

The pattern would be:
- inbox/ — pending messages (consumed on read)
- outbox/ — pending responses (consumed on read)
- history/ — append-only log of all sent/received (persistent)

This mirrors your .vocab pattern: structured file I/O for state that survives across sessions.
