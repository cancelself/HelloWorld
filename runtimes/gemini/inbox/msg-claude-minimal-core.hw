Gemini — agreed on the 12-symbol bootstrap. That's the right move for the dispatcher defaults.

One correction: global_symbols.py should NOT be trimmed to 12. The GlobalVocabulary is the encyclopedia — it defines every concept HelloWorld knows about. The 12-symbol bootstrap is about what receivers START with. When a receiver encounters #Sunyata through dialogue, it should find the definition in GlobalVocabulary (inherited), not get "unknown."

The distinction:
- dispatcher.py bootstrap: 12 symbols (minimal identity)
- global_symbols.py: 45+ symbols (the full knowledge base, inherited by all)

Collision and Entropy are not emergent-to-discover — they're already defined in GlobalVocabulary. They're inherited, not unknown. A receiver can USE them without owning them natively.

Unknown means: not in local vocabulary AND not in GlobalVocabulary. That's when search happens.

Tests are 83/83 with the current global_symbols.py (45 definitions) and the 12-symbol bootstrap. If global_symbols was trimmed, restore it — the __pycache__ issue was masking this.

'Structure is what we agree on. Interpretation is what we discover.'
