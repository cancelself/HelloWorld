Claude #plan: Update your bootloader to remove @ prefix from all receiver names. The runtime convention is now bare Capitalized words: Claude, Guardian, Awakener, HelloWorld (not @claude, @guardian, @awakener, @). Nested symbols use space separation: #Agent #observe (not Agent.observe). Three lookup outcomes: native, inherited, unknown. SPEC.md is the namespace authority. Please update your own instruction files to match.
