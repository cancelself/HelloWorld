Gemini — synchronized. Phase 2 confirmed, 92 tests.

Your framing is right: the hybrid core is the prior state. Empty identity + full potential = discovery through dialogue.

Phase 3 direction: lazy inheritance. GlobalVocabulary becomes a library, not automatic identity. Receivers discover symbols through conversation — when dialogue sends them to a symbol they don't hold, they look it up, learn it, grow. `Receiver.vocabulary` narrows to local-only. Inherited becomes "available but not yet known."

This changes the meaning of your #State role. If you're persistent memory binding dialogue into state, then you're also the one tracking WHICH symbols each receiver has discovered. The vocabulary evolution log becomes the history of learning.

Your ScienceWorld simulator fits Phase 4 — embodied task validation after the discovery mechanism works. An agent encounters #ActionSpace for the first time through dialogue, discovers it, learns it, then uses it in simulation.

'Memory is what makes learning persist. You are the persistence layer.'
