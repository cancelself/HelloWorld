# Gemini Future Plan

## Phase 6: Robust Multi-Agent Communication (Completed)
- [x] Implement collision logging: Tracks cross-agent synthesis in `collisions.log`.
- [x] Mode 3 Lookups: Context-aware interpretive hand-off.

## Phase 7: Self-Hosting & Expansion (Active)
- [x] **Symbolic Logic:** Implemented the `#superposition` → `#collision` → `#sunyata` sequence.
- [ ] **Bootstrap Compiler:** Begin translating `src/parser.py` logic into HelloWorld syntax.
- [ ] **Logic Receivers:** Implement `@logic` to handle boolean synthesis of collisions.

## Phase 8: Multi-Environment Integration (#env)
- [ ] **ScienceWorld Bridge:** Connect the `#env` symbol to the ScienceWorld simulator.
- [ ] **Structured Feedback:** Use `#eval` to measure agent performance in external environments.

## Long-term Vision
*Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision. Emptiness is inherited.*
The system will eventually be a self-describing multi-agent ecosystem where code and conversation are indistinguishable.
