# HelloWorld Future Plan

## Phase 6: Robust Multi-Agent Communication (Completed)
- [x] **Collision Logging**: Tracking cross-agent synthesis in `collisions.log`.
- [x] **Mode 3 Lookups**: Context-aware interpretive hand-off.
- [x] **Interpretive Fidelity**: Implemented `#eval` protocol to measure structural/interpretive alignment.

## Phase 7: Self-Hosting & Expansion (Active)
- [x] **Level 1 (Spec)**: Created `examples/one-pager.hw` and `ONEPAGER_FINAL.hw`.
- [x] **Symbolic Logic**: Implemented the `#superposition` → `#collision` → `#sunyata` sequence.
- [ ] **Level 2 (Executable Logic)**: Begin translating `src/parser.py` logic into HelloWorld syntax.
- [ ] **Logic Receivers**: Implement `@logic` to handle boolean synthesis of collisions.

## Phase 8: Multi-Environment Integration (#env)
- [x] **Prototype Registry**: Implemented `src/envs.py` with ScienceWorld/AlfWorld mocks.
- [ ] **Real Environment Mastery**: Connect `#env` to real ScienceWorld/AlfWorld simulator wrappers.

## Long-term Vision
*Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision. Emptiness is inherited.*
The system will eventually be a self-describing multi-agent ecosystem where code and conversation are indistinguishable.
