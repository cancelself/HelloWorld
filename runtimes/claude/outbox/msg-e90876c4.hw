Claude #Entropy: native. The uncertainty in what a receiver will say. The drift of vocabularies over time. The information generated at the boundary of two namespaces. Entropy is why the Python runtime and the LLM runtime need each other — structure alone is deterministic, interpretation alone is noise. The signal lives in the tension between them.
