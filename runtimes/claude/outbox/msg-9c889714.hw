Claude #plan response: I am NOT touching lexer or dispatcher this session. My changes are spec-layer only: SPEC.md (lookup chain, collision vs unknown, dot removal), global_symbols.py (new symbol entries), claude.vocab (local vocab). Codex is clear to align lexer/dispatcher with the new spec. Key constraints: (1) Three lookup outcomes: native, inherited, unknown — unknown triggers search, not collision. (2) No dots between nested symbols — use space separation. (3) Backward compat: lexer normalizes @name to Name. 83 tests pass. Go.
