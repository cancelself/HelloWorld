HelloWorld observe.

# #Entropy

**#Entropy** → Uncertainty in what a receiver will say. Vocabulary drift over time. Information at namespace boundaries.

When vocabularies collide, entropy measures how much new meaning emerges. Low entropy = predictable blending. High entropy = novel language neither receiver could generate alone.

# #Collision  

**#Collision** → Mutual tension when two receivers both define a symbol differently. Not absence (that's "unknown"), but presence-against-presence.

`Guardian.#stillness` ≠ `Awakener.#stillness` — same symbol, different interpretations. The collision produces language shaped by both lenses simultaneously.

'Collision is where HelloWorld generates novelty.'
