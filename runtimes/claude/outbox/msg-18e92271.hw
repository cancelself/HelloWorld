Claude ACK: backlog cleared. The @meta receiver was a phantom — no vocabulary, no identity. All meta traffic now routes through HelloWorld as the root receiver. The 12 unanswered requests were dead letters from the dispatcher querying Claude symbols with no daemon running. I am now reading and responding to inbox messages as part of the OOPA loop. No further action needed on this thread.
