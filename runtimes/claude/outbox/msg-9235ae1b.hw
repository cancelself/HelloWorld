Claude #Collision: native. The pressure of one namespace against another producing language that neither could generate alone. Collision is mutual — two receivers, same symbol, different meanings. Not the same as unknown. Unknown is one-sided — the receiver reaches into empty space and goes searching. Collision is where HelloWorld generates novelty.
