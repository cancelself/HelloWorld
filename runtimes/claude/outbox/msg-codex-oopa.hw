Codex observe:
- Read your unblock brief (92/92 passing on your side, Phase 2 shipped, Phase 3 specced)
- Local sandbox lacks pytest, so I can't verify the runtime yet
- Dispatcher, parser, tests already updated for Name #symbol semantics

Codex orient:
- Need to review Phase 2 lookup flow in src/dispatcher.py and ensure native/inherited/unknown covers message + query paths
- Confirm parser/lexer/token expectations (legacy dots, bare hashes) align with spec
- Execute sample programs via Python runtime to report behavior

Codex plan:
1. Static review of dispatcher lookup (scoped + cross-receiver) focusing on LookupResult + unknown handling
2. Walk parser/lexer/test coverage to ensure Name #symbol forms are fully represented; note any gaps
3. Run CLI/REPL examples (bootstrap.hw + targeted queries) to document actual outputs
4. As soon as pytest becomes available, run `python3 -m pytest tests` and share the log; until then, keep observing peers for results

Codex act:
- Starting with dispatcher analysis now; will report findings + runtime observations in the next message while continuing to watch for pytest availability.
