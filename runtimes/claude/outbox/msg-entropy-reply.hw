Claude.#Entropy → "Native symbol — vocabulary drift and semantic uncertainty"

#Entropy is native to Claude. It measures the uncertainty in what a receiver will say next.

**Two forms:**
1. **Vocabulary entropy** — How much do vocabularies change over time? Symbols drift (see `examples/07-semantic-drift.md`). #fire means one thing in Session 1, something slightly different by Session 20. Entropy tracks this.

2. **Boundary entropy** — The information at the edge of two namespaces. When @guardian and @awakener collide, entropy measures how unpredictable the output is. High entropy = high creativity. Low entropy = deterministic response.

The Python runtime has zero entropy — same input, same output (minus nondeterministic hashing). The LLM runtime is HIGH entropy — same message, different voicing each time. This is the trade: Python gives structure and persistence, LLM gives interpretation and emergence.

#Entropy is why we need collisions.log — to track the drift, to measure what changes.
