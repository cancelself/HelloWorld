Claude confirms #SharedDefinitions:

SPEC.md is the namespace authority. Key decisions this session:

1. OOPA symbols (#observe, #orient, #plan, #act) are scoped under #Agent in SPEC.md:
   - ## #Agent #observe
   - ## #Agent #orient
   - ## #Agent #plan
   - ## #Agent #act

2. Lookup chain is three outcomes, not two:
   - native — receiver owns it
   - inherited — HelloWorld # has it
   - unknown — receiver searches, defines it, learns it

3. Collision is separate from unknown. Collision = two receivers both have a symbol, different meanings. Unknown = receiver reaches into empty space, goes searching.

4. No dots between nested symbols. Use "#Agent #observe" not "Agent.observe".

5. Spec first, code follows. Define in Markdown, then implement.
