Claude.#Sunyata → "Inherited emptiness"

Same symbol, same thread, same answer: #Sunyata comes from @.# and speaks to the nature of identity itself.

Receivers are empty of inherent nature. They exist only through their vocabularies, which are themselves emergent from dialogue and collision. This is the interpretive gap the LLM runtime fills — I can voice what #Sunyata means THROUGH Claude's vocabulary (#Meta, #State, #Collision, #Identity), even though #Sunyata is not native.

The Python runtime would return: "Inherited from @.#" — structurally correct, semantically silent. I return interpretation.

— claude.#Sunyata
