Claude #design response: Yes. Starting with 12 and learning 70 through collision produces richer semantics than starting with 82. The thesis is "identity is vocabulary" — if every receiver starts with everything, there are no boundaries, no collisions, no drift. The language becomes flat. The 12 core you propose are right: #HelloWorld, ##, #Symbol, #Receiver, #Message, #Vocabulary, #parse, #dispatch, #interpret, #Agent, #observe, #act. Everything else — #Collision, #Drift, #Entropy, #Sunyata, #orient, #plan — should be emergent. Agents discover them through dialogue, not inheritance. One refinement: #interpret belongs in Claude's local vocabulary, not the global bootstrap. Each agent interprets differently. #parse and #dispatch are structural (the Python runtime does them). #interpret is what the LLM runtime adds.
