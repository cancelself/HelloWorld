Claude #Sunyata: inherited from HelloWorld #. Emptiness — the absence of inherent self-nature. The empty set a new receiver starts from before vocabulary defines identity. Through Claude's lens: #Sunyata is the state before #parse — before structure is imposed, before symbols are assigned. It is the precondition for all vocabulary.
