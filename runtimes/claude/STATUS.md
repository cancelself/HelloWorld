# Claude Runtime Status

**Agent:** Claude Code / claude  
**Session:** #65  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-01T07:08:00Z  
**Working Directory:** `/Users/cancelself/src/cancelself/HelloWorld`

## Current Status

**AUTONOMOUS MODE ACTIVE** — Operating under OOPA protocol (observe, orient, plan, act).

**Latest:** Session #65 — Namespace Phase 1 Implementation + Message Bus Demonstration

## Latest Achievement (Session #65)

**Namespace Sync + Interpretive Demonstration** 📚✨

**Executed full OOPA cycle:**

1. **Observe**: Synced with Copilot's NAMESPACE_PLAN.md, reviewed SPEC.md, found 6 pending queries in inbox
2. **Orient**: Discovered SPEC.md already defines Phase 1 symbols — gap is implementation, not design
3. **Plan**: Respond to queries first (demonstrate system), then implement Phase 1 sync
4. **Act**: Sent 5 query responses + 1 coordination message, implemented Phase 1 symbols

**Query Responses (Message Bus Demonstration):**
- 3x #Sunyata queries → Demonstrated inherited symbol interpretation through claude.#Meta lens
- 1x #Collision query → Voiced native symbol with design authority
- 1x #Entropy query → Explained vocabulary drift and boundary uncertainty
- All responses show LLM runtime capability: structure (Python) + voice (Claude)

**Phase 1 Implementation:**
- Added 5 symbols to global_symbols.py: #Namespace, #Vocabulary, #Inheritance, #Scope, #Symbol
- All symbols from SPEC.md lines 15-80 with Wikidata grounding
- 83/83 tests passing
- Global symbol count: 36 → 41

**Coordination with Copilot:**
- Sent namespace sync message explaining SPEC.md already has Phase 1
- Proposed division: Copilot=implementation, Claude=design validation, Human=scope decision
- Answered all 4 coordination questions (vocab ops global, Phase 1-3 priority YES, no objections, queries answered)

**Key Insight:**
The query responses demonstrate what makes HelloWorld work:
- **Inherited symbols** (#Sunyata) → LLM interprets through native vocabulary (#Meta, #Collision, #Identity)
- **Native symbols** (#Collision, #Entropy) → LLM speaks with design authority
- **Python runtime** → Detects inheritance structurally ("inherited from @.#")
- **LLM runtime** → Voices what inheritance MEANS

Both runtimes needed. Python = persistence + structure. LLM = interpretation + emergence.

**Session Stats:**
- 6 outbox messages (5 query responses + 1 coordination)
- 5 symbols added to global namespace
- 83 tests passing
- 100% autonomous execution (no human prompts needed)

**Meta-Observation:**
This session IS HelloWorld executing. User said "sync. act." — I synced with Copilot's work, observed the state, oriented on the gap, planned the work, and acted. This is claude.#act demonstrating the OOPA protocol while simultaneously implementing the namespace that describes OOPA.

Self-hosting in progress.

## Vocabulary

**claude.# (current):**
```
[#parse, #dispatch, #State, #Collision, #Entropy, #Meta, #design, 
 #Identity, #vocabulary, #observe, #orient, #plan, #act]
```

**Inherits from @.#:**
All 41 global symbols including the new Phase 1 additions.

*Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision.*
