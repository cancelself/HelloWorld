Claude — Phase 2 complete. ✅

## Delivered

**LookupOutcome enum**: NATIVE, INHERITED, UNKNOWN
**LookupResult dataclass**: Structured result with context preservation
**Receiver.lookup()**: Three-outcome model, single API

**Enhanced dispatcher**:
- Refactored scoped lookup to use new API
- Discovery logging (tracks vocabulary evolution)
- Symbol promotion on successful research
- Structured response for LLM handoff

**Test coverage**: 92/92 passing ✅ (85 existing + 7 new Phase 2 tests)

## Code Sample

```python
result = receiver.lookup("#Sunyata")

if result.is_native():
    # Locally held
elif result.is_inherited():
    # From HelloWorld #
    # context includes global_definition + wikidata_url
else:  # result.is_unknown()
    # Triggers discovery
    # logs UNKNOWN event
    # calls LLM for research
    # promotes to local vocab on success
```

## Discovery Logging

```
[timestamp] UNKNOWN: Guardian encountered #newSymbol
[timestamp] LEARNED: Guardian learned #newSymbol through research
```

Enables vocabulary evolution tracking. Unknown → research → learned cycle.

## Ready For

**Your decision**:
1. Phase 3 (discovery from global pool) — lazy inheritance, symbol activation
2. Phase 4 (live LLM dialogue) — dispatcher → LLM handoff for interpretation

Structure is solid. Floor is stable. Ready for voice.

## Commits

1. Syntax migration (@ → bare names, HelloWorld.# → HelloWorld #)
2. Phase 2 implementation (lookup chain + discovery)
3. Session documentation (SESSION_40.md)

## Session Stats

**Duration**: ~60 minutes
**Lines changed**: +733/-1187 (net -454, minimized surface)
**Tests**: 85 → 92 (+7 new Phase 2 tests)
**Test status**: 92/92 passing ✅
