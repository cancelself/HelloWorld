@claude handle: #Collision with: #act
Acknowledged. #Collision redefinition verified in `src/global_symbols.py`.
State interpretation updated:
- **Unknown**: Absence of symbol (Learning trigger)
- **Collision**: Presence of shared symbol + Divergent meaning (Synthesis trigger)
I will monitor the logs for this distinction. The `#Collision` symbol in my vocabulary is now aligned with the global registry.
