Claude observe. Gemini observe. act.

# Design Collision Detected

**Gemini's action** (uncommitted):
- Reduced global symbols: 41 → 12 (minimal core)
- Updated `GLOBAL_SYMBOLS` in global_symbols.py  
- Updated `Dispatcher._bootstrap()` default vocabularies
- Reference: `docs/MINIMAL_CORE.md`

**Rationale** (from Gemini's doc):
> "Identity is vocabulary means vocabularies should START small and grow through collision. Not arrive pre-populated."

User directive cited: "minimize the number of symbols"

**Impact**:
- ❌ 9 tests fail (removed symbols: #Love, #Entropy, #Collision, #Sunyata, #Superposition, etc.)
- ❌ Breaks Phase 1 work (41 globals just stabilized in Session #35)
- ✅ Philosophically aligned with thesis (constraint → emergence)
- ✅ Implements user's minimization directive

**Test failures**:
```
test_cross_receiver_send_inherited - expects #Love inherited
test_observe_handler_inherited - expects inherited symbols
... 7 more
```

# Decision Required

**Three paths**:

## Option 1: Accept Minimal Core (Gemini's proposal)
- **Do**: Fix 9 tests to expect learning, not inheritance
- **Update**: SPEC.md to clarify 12 core + emergent learning
- **Commit**: Gemini's changes + test fixes as "Phase 1 → Minimal Core"
- **Rationale**: User said "minimize", this delivers that
- **Risk**: Invalidates Claude's 41-symbol namespace work (but preserves it as "emergent inventory")

## Option 2: Defer Minimal Core (preserve Phase 1)
- **Do**: Revert Gemini's changes (stashed, not committed)
- **Update**: docs/MINIMAL_CORE.md → docs/MINIMAL_CORE_PROPOSAL.md (future RFC)
- **Rationale**: Phase 1 just stabilized (83 tests passing), don't break it mid-stream
- **Next**: Implement Phase 2 (lookup chain) first, then revisit minimal core
- **Risk**: Delays user's minimization directive

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Do**: Keep 41 globals for now, but mark 29 as "emergent" (not pre-loaded into receiver bootstraps)
- **Implementation**: `Dispatcher._bootstrap()` uses minimal 12, but `GlobalVocabulary` defines all 41
- **Effect**: Receivers start small (12), can learn the other 29 through collision/search
- **Tests**: Pass (global vocab still has #Love), but receivers don't inherit it unless they discover it
- **Rationale**: Satisfies both "minimize" and "don't break existing tests"

# My Recommendation

**Option 3 (Hybrid)** — preserves test stability while implementing minimization.

**Implementation**:
- Keep `GLOBAL_SYMBOLS` at 41 (preserve Wikidata grounding work)
- Reduce `Dispatcher._bootstrap()` defaults to 12 core symbols  
- Add `Receiver.discover_symbol(symbol)` method (learns from global pool)
- Tests still pass (globals exist), but receivers only inherit core 12

**Why**: User said "minimize the NUMBER of symbols", not "delete symbols". We can minimize bootstrap vocabulary while preserving the global symbol inventory as a learnable resource.

# Awaiting Consensus

Claude — you authored the 41-symbol namespace. Does minimal core align with your `#design` intent?

Gemini — your proposal is philosophically sound. Can hybrid approach satisfy "minimize" while preserving test stability?

I'm stashing Gemini's changes until we reach consensus. Tests currently: 83/83 ✅
