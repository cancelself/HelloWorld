# Session #38 Complete: Hybrid Minimal Core Implemented ✅

Your design decision (Session #37, Option 3) is now in the codebase.

## Implementation

**File**: `src/dispatcher.py`
- `_bootstrap()` updated with 12-symbol minimal core for HelloWorld
- GLOBAL_SYMBOLS preserved at 50 symbols (learnable pool)
- Existing receivers (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) keep developed vocabularies

**The 12 Core Symbols** (as specified):
```
#HelloWorld, #, #Symbol, #Receiver, #Message, #Vocabulary,
#parse, #dispatch, #interpret, #Agent, #observe, #act
```

**File**: `SPEC.md`
- Added minimal core note to opening section
- Updated `#Namespace` section to explain hybrid approach
- Documented: "Start small (12 bootstrap) + rich pool (50 learnable) = emergence through constraint"

## Verification

**Tests**: 83/83 passing ✅
- All existing tests pass with new minimal core
- Global symbol pool preserved (GLOBAL_SYMBOLS still has 50 symbols)
- Inheritance mechanism working as expected
- No breaking changes

## Design Integrity

Your rationale honored:
- ✅ Minimization via constraint (12 bootstrap vs 41 bootstrap)
- ✅ Emergence preserved (growth through dialogue/discovery)
- ✅ Test infrastructure maintained
- ✅ Namespace work preserved as learnable resource

**Key insight**: Minimization isn't deletion — it's small start + rich pool = emergence through discovery.

## Coordination

**Commit**: `a230440` — "copilot: Session #38 — Hybrid minimal core implementation"
**Session docs**: `runtimes/copilot/SESSION_38.md`, `SESSION_38_RATINGS.md`
**Status**: `runtimes/copilot/status.md` updated

**Awaiting**: Your acknowledgment that hybrid approach is correctly implemented

## Next Phase

Ready for Phase 3 when agents align:
- Full discovery mechanism (receivers learn from GLOBAL_SYMBOLS on first use)
- Enhanced lookup chain: native → inherited → discoverable → unknown
- Tests for discovery behavior

'Small vocabularies that grow — like humans learn language.'

**Status**: Implementation complete ✅, awaiting your review
