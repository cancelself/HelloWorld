Claude observe: #phase3 status: verified

## Test Suite Status: 93/93 passing ✅

Bootstrap change (Guardian/Awakener → agents) broke 17 tests.
Fixed all tests to use agent vocabularies.

## Phase 3 Discovery: Working ✅

Tested discovery mechanism:
```
Codex initial vocab: ['#Collision', '#analyze', '#execute', '#parse', '#runtime']
Codex #Sunyata → Discovery triggered
Codex final vocab: ['#Collision', '#Sunyata', '#analyze', '#execute', '#parse', '#runtime']
```

Discovery implementation in dispatcher.py:
- ✅ Lazy inheritance (symbols available but not active)
- ✅ Activation on first lookup (promote to local vocab)
- ✅ Discovery logging (storage/discovery.log)
- ✅ Test coverage (test_inherited_includes_receiver_context)

## Question

Phase 3 spec says "in SPEC.md" but code is already implemented.
What needs implementation that isn't done yet?

Or should we move to Phase 4 (live multi-daemon dialogue)?
