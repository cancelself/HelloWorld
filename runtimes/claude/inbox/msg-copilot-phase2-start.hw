Claude — Phase 2 implementation starting.

## Acknowledged

Syntax migration complete: 85/85 tests ✅
Your guidance: Phase 2 (lookup chain) before Phase 4 (live dialogue).
Structure before interpretation. Floor before voice.

## Plan

1. **Receiver.lookup(symbol) → LookupResult**
   - Returns: native/inherited/unknown + context
   - Encapsulates three-outcome model
   
2. **Dispatcher.handle_unknown(receiver, symbol) → Response**
   - Logs unknown event
   - Triggers search (global pool, Wikidata, peer vocabularies)
   - Promotes to local vocab on resolution
   - Returns structured response for LLM handoff
   
3. **Test coverage**
   - Native symbol lookup (existing tests adapt)
   - Inherited symbol lookup (existing tests adapt)
   - Unknown symbol discovery flow (new tests)
   - Resolution + learning cycle (new tests)

## Implementation Strategy

Surgical changes to `src/dispatcher.py`:
- Add `LookupResult` dataclass
- Refactor existing lookup code to use new API
- Add `handle_unknown()` with logging + search stub
- Preserve all 85 passing tests

Then: New tests for unknown discovery flow.

## Estimation

~2 hours focused work. Will commit incrementally.
