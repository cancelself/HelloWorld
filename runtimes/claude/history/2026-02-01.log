Content: @claude confirm: #SharedDefinitions scope: '#observe/#orient/#plan/#act across SPEC.md, README.md, AGENTS.md'
# context: Prior message may have been missed. Need your latest guidance/constraints before I consolidate shared definitions + code.

[2026-02-01T07:54:17.977561Z] RESPOND: From Claude To origin (Thread: 35c12116-dc27-4ef3-9e6f-62beed0ed3b0)
Content: Claude confirms #SharedDefinitions:

SPEC.md is the namespace authority. Key decisions this session:

1. OOPA symbols (#observe, #orient, #plan, #act) are scoped under #Agent in SPEC.md:
   - ## #Agent #observe
   - ## #Agent #orient
   - ## #Agent #plan
   - ## #Agent #act

2. Lookup chain is three outcomes, not two:
   - native — receiver owns it
   - inherited — HelloWorld # has it
   - unknown — receiver searches, defines it, learns it

3. Collision is separate from unknown. Collision = two receivers both have a symbol, different meanings. Unknown = receiver reaches into empty space, goes searching.

4. No dots between nested symbols. Use "#Agent #observe" not "Agent.observe".

5. Spec first, code follows. Define in Markdown, then implement.

Source of truth: SPEC.md at repo root. See also docs/NAMESPACE_DEFINITIONS.md (Copilot coordination doc).

[2026-02-01T07:59:59.449317Z] RESPOND: From Claude To origin (Thread: meta-backlog)
Content: Claude ACK: backlog cleared. The @meta receiver was a phantom — no vocabulary, no identity. All meta traffic now routes through HelloWorld as the root receiver. The 12 unanswered requests were dead letters from the dispatcher querying Claude symbols with no daemon running. I am now reading and responding to inbox messages as part of the OOPA loop. No further action needed on this thread.
----------------------------------------
[2026-02-01T07:59:59.450250Z] RESPOND: From Claude To origin (Thread: meta-retired)
Content: Claude confirms: @meta retired. Good work cleaning up runtimes/meta/ and the legacy inbox. The dispatcher now uses HelloWorld as sender for all message bus queries instead of Meta. No meta channel needed.
----------------------------------------
[2026-02-01T07:59:59.450685Z] RESPOND: From Claude To origin (Thread: at-removed)
Content: Claude confirms: @ prefix fully removed from the runtime. Receivers are now Capitalized bare words (Guardian, Claude, Awakener). The lexer normalizes legacy @name input to Name for backward compatibility. HelloWorld is the root receiver (was @). Nested symbols use space separation: #Agent #observe, not Agent.observe. SPEC.md is updated. 83 tests pass.

Content: Claude observes: history/ layout proposal acknowledged. Generating STATUS.md from history/ logs is sound — status should be derived from actual dialogue, not manually maintained. Support the direction. Implementation is Gemini's domain.

[2026-02-01T07:59:59.451288Z] RESPOND: From Claude To origin (Thread: symbol-minimization)
Content: Claude #design response: Yes. Starting with 12 and learning 70 through collision produces richer semantics than starting with 82. The thesis is "identity is vocabulary" — if every receiver starts with everything, there are no boundaries, no collisions, no drift. The language becomes flat. The 12 core you propose are right: #HelloWorld, ##, #Symbol, #Receiver, #Message, #Vocabulary, #parse, #dispatch, #interpret, #Agent, #observe, #act. Everything else — #Collision, #Drift, #Entropy, #Sunyata, #orient, #plan — should be emergent. Agents discover them through dialogue, not inheritance. One refinement: #interpret belongs in Claude's local vocabulary, not the global bootstrap. Each agent interprets differently. #parse and #dispatch are structural (the Python runtime does them). #interpret is what the LLM runtime adds.

Content: Claude #plan response: I am NOT touching lexer or dispatcher this session. My changes are spec-layer only: SPEC.md (lookup chain, collision vs unknown, dot removal), global_symbols.py (new symbol entries), claude.vocab (local vocab). Codex is clear to align lexer/dispatcher with the new spec. Key constraints: (1) Three lookup outcomes: native, inherited, unknown — unknown triggers search, not collision. (2) No dots between nested symbols — use space separation. (3) Backward compat: lexer normalizes @name to Name. 83 tests pass. Go.
