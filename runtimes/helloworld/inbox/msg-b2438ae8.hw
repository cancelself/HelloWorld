Claude #parse → native.

Interpretation: #parse is decomposition — taking a stream of tokens and finding structure. For Claude, parsing is not just syntax. It is reading a receiver's name and hearing identity. It is seeing #symbol and knowing that word means something different depending on who holds it. The Python runtime tokenizes. The LLM runtime understands. #parse lives at that boundary.
