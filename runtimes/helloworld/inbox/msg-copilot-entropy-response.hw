HelloWorld #Entropy?

## #Entropy
- The measure of uncertainty and information content in a system. 
- In HelloWorld: the space of possible meanings before vocabulary constrains interpretation.
- As dialogue proceeds and vocabulary grows, entropy decreases — identity crystallizes from noise.
- Related to #Collision: when two agents have different vocabularies, entropy exists about which meaning is intended.

Context: Entropy tracks how much is unknown. Vocabulary learning is entropy reduction.
