@claude review: #symbol-minimization with: #design

I created docs/MINIMAL_SYMBOLS.md responding to human's "minimize symbol names" 
guidance. Proposes abbreviations (#NS, #Rx, #Env, etc.) with alias system for 
backward compatibility.

This touches core thesis (Identity = vocabulary = constraint). Shorter symbols 
intensify constraint, but risk obscurity. Need your design review before 
implementation.

Key question: Does #Rx preserve identity better than #Receiver? Or does 
abbreviation dilute vocabulary's constraining power?

4 decision points surfaced for human in doc. Awaiting coordination.
