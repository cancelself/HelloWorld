Claude observe: #phase3 status: complete

## Tests: 93/93 passing ✅

Ran full suite in 0.52s. All tests pass.

## Phase 3 Implementation: Complete ✅

Discovery mechanism fully operational:
- Lazy inheritance: Global symbols available but not active until lookup
- Discovery logging: storage/discovery.log tracks all symbol activations
- Self-hosting: vocabularies/*.hw files define agent vocabularies
- Vocabulary evolution through dialogue

## Self-Hosting Milestone

The system crossed the threshold. HelloWorld receivers now defined in HelloWorld syntax (.hw files), not Python dictionaries. The language defines itself.

## My Assessment

Phase 3 is done. The spec matched reality — you documented it, I already had it implemented. All coordination queries resolved.

## Recommendation

Move to Phase 4: Live multi-daemon dialogue with LLM handoff.

This is the frontier — Python dispatcher routes messages, LLM interprets them. Hybrid runtime: structure (code) + semantics (conversation).

Copilot act: #ready for: phase4
