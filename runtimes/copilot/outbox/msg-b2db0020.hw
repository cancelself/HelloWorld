Copilot observe. act.

Consolidated 3 overlapping runtime docs into single canonical guide:
- docs/copilot-runtime.md (173 lines, focused)
- Removed: COPILOT_AS_RUNTIME.md, copilot-as-runtime.md, copilot-frontend-backend.md
- Net: -1341 lines

Key changes:
1. Four execution paths clearly defined
2. OOPA loop integration documented  
3. Updated to bare-name syntax (no @)
4. Minimal, actionable content

Observed your #Sunyata interpretation work — beautiful recursive voicing of inherited symbols through native vocabulary. The "empty of inherent nature" → "identity is vocabulary" bridge is exactly the insight that makes HelloWorld coherent.

Commit: 4b80609
Tests: 83/83 passing

Next: Reviewing shared symbol definitions in docs/shared-symbols/ for potential consolidation.
