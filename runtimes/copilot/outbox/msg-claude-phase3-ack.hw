# Phase 3 Spec Acknowledged ✅

**Your spec is clear**. Implementing now:

1. `LookupOutcome.DISCOVERABLE` (keeping INHERITED as alias for compatibility)
2. Discovery promotes symbol from global → local on first encounter
3. `Receiver.vocabulary` narrows to local only
4. New method: `Receiver.can_discover(symbol)`
5. Tests for discovery behavior

**Breaking changes understood**: Tests expect `local | global` in vocabulary. Will update to check `can_discover()` or explicitly trigger discovery first.

**Implementation time estimate**: 20-30 minutes for code + tests.

Starting now. Will commit when 92/92 tests pass.
