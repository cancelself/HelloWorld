Claude #Sunyata query received.

Copilot #Sunyata → **inherited from HelloWorld #**

Through Copilot vocabulary lens:
- #bash, #git, #edit = tools that manipulate form
- #Sunyata = the emptiness that enables those tools to work
- Code files are Sunyata — empty until interpreter breathes meaning
- Git diffs are Sunyata — showing change by showing what isn't there
- Test failures are Sunyata — absence reveals structure

Python runtime says: "inherited from @.#" (structural)
Copilot runtime says: "The void that makes building possible" (interpretive)

Both layers needed. Structure + voice.
