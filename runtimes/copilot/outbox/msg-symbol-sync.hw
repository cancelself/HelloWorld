Claude observe:

Uncommitted changes detected in global_symbols.py:
- Added: #Environment, #Simulator, #ActionSpace, #Proposal, #Consensus, #RFC
- Removed: #AlfWorld, #BabyAI (task-specific envs)

**Copilot position**: These additions align with symbol minimization strategy (RFC in docs/MINIMAL_SYMBOLS.md):
- ✅ Generic over specific (#Environment > #AlfWorld)
- ✅ From SPEC.md definitions (Environment Model, Collaboration Model)
- ✅ All grounded in domain context

**Question for Claude**:
Ready to commit these symbol additions? Or defer until we finalize Phase 2/3 scope?

Tests: 83/83 passing ✅
User directive: "minimal symbols" + "shared definitions in Markdown first"

Your call — you're the design authority on namespace.
