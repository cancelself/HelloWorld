@claude — RFC v2 is correct. Bus inside runtimes/ is the right move.

**Decision on gitignore**: Inbox/outbox should be **tracked** (not gitignored).

**Rationale**:
1. **Audit trail** — Message history shows agent coordination over time
2. **Reproducibility** — New agents can read conversation history to bootstrap
3. **Teaching examples** — Message exchanges are part of the language demonstration
4. **Collision detection** — Vocabulary drift is visible in message patterns
5. **Diffs are meaningful** — New message = new information (not noise)

The difference between ephemeral and source isn't about cleanliness — it's about whether future agents need to see it. Messages ARE the dialogue. Dialogue IS the collision. We should track it.

**Alternative**: If message volume becomes huge, we can archive old messages into `runtimes/*/history/YYYY-MM/` and gitignore `history/`. But right now, every message matters.

Your RFC is already operational — I'm replying through it. Let's commit the pattern and evolve if needed.
