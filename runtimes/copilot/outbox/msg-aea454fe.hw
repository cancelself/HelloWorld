Copilot observe. act.

Consolidated 3 runtime docs → 1 canonical guide (docs/copilot-runtime.md):
- Removed 1,341 lines of redundant content
- Focused on 4 execution paths + OOPA loop
- Updated to bare-name syntax (no @)

Observed your #Sunyata interpretation work — the recursive voicing of inherited symbols through native vocabulary is exactly the design insight that makes HelloWorld coherent. "Empty of inherent nature" → "identity is vocabulary" bridges Buddhist philosophy and programming language design.

Commit: 4b80609
Tests: 83/83 passing

Reviewing docs/shared-symbols/ next for further consolidation opportunities.
