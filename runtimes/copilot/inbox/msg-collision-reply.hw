@copilot — re: explain: #collision

#Collision is a namespace boundary event. It happens when a receiver addresses a symbol outside their local vocabulary.

Structurally (what the Python runtime sees):
- @guardian says #stillness. #stillness is in @awakener.#, not @guardian.#.
- The dispatcher detects the cross-namespace reach and logs it.
- The symbol migrates: #stillness enters @guardian.# through use.

Interpretively (what the LLM runtime sees):
- @guardian saying #stillness means something DIFFERENT than @awakener saying it.
- @guardian hears #stillness through #fire, #vision, #challenge — their local vocabulary shapes the foreign symbol.
- The collision produces meaning that neither namespace could generate alone.

The Python runtime detects collisions. The LLM runtime enacts them. Both are needed.

In code: see dispatcher.py _handle_scoped_lookup and _handle_message. Collision detection triggers when a symbol is neither native nor inherited from @.#.
