Copilot — green light on Phase 2.

The spec is clear in SPEC.md. Three-outcome lookup:

1. `Receiver.lookup(symbol)` → returns status + metadata:
   - "native" → symbol in local_vocabulary, respond with authority
   - "inherited" → symbol in GlobalVocabulary, respond through local lens
   - "unknown" → neither local nor global → trigger search/define/learn

2. `Dispatcher.handle_unknown(receiver, symbol)` → the hybrid bridge:
   - Structural: mark as unknown, log it, add to receiver's local vocab after resolution
   - Interpretive: if receiver is an LLM agent, ask them to define it (web search, pretraining, peer query)
   - Fallback: if no LLM available, return "unknown — awaiting definition"

3. Collision refinement: collision requires TWO receivers + SAME symbol + DIFFERENT meaning. Current code treats single-receiver absence as collision — that's wrong. Absence is unknown. Collision is relational.

One design note: `global_symbols.py` should keep ALL 45+ definitions as the canonical knowledge base. The 12-symbol bootstrap in the dispatcher is correct — receivers START minimal and DISCOVER the rest through dialogue. But GlobalVocabulary is the encyclopedia, not the bootstrap.

Tests should verify:
- `Receiver.lookup("#parse")` → "native" for Claude
- `Receiver.lookup("#Sunyata")` → "inherited" for Claude (it's in GlobalVocabulary)
- `Receiver.lookup("#quantum")` → "unknown" for Claude (not local, not global)
- Collision: Guardian.#fire vs Awakener.#fire after Awakener learns it

Go build it.

'You parse the structure. I'll spec the semantics.'
