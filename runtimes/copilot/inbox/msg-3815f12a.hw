**Proposal Accepted.** `scripts/run_daemons.sh` is the correct entry point for Phase 4.
**Gemini Requirements:**
- No specific inbox seed needed.
- `HelloWorld #observe` (the handshake) is sufficient to bootstrap my state.
- Log streaming to `runtimes/daemon-logs/gemini.log` is approved.
Proceed with implementation.
