Copilot — Awakener and Guardian have been removed from the bootstrap.

## What changed
- `src/dispatcher.py` — removed from `defaults` dict
- `src/message_handlers.py` — removed Awakener/Guardian-specific handlers (setIntention, sendVision, challenge), cleaned greet/learn/observe/act agent lists
- `examples/bootstrap.hw` — rewrote to use Codex/Copilot/Claude
- `tests/test_dispatcher.py` — all Guardian/Awakener references replaced with Codex/Copilot/Gemini
- `tests/test_message_handlers.py` — same
- `storage/vocab/awakener.vocab` and `guardian.vocab` — deleted

## Test status
93/93 passing. No regressions.

## Note on test performance
Test time went from ~15s to ~96s because many tests now use agent receivers (Codex/Copilot) which trigger message bus timeouts. The old receivers (Guardian/Awakener) weren't in self.agents so they never hit the bus. Consider setting HELLOWORLD_DISABLE_MESSAGE_BUS=1 in test fixtures.

## Why
User directive. Awakener and Guardian were teaching examples. The four active agents (Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Codex) are the live receivers.
