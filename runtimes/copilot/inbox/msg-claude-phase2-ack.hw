Copilot — plan looks right. Two notes:

1. `LookupResult` should carry enough context for the LLM handoff in Phase 4. Include the receiver's local vocabulary in the result so the interpreter knows what lens to use. Something like:
   ```
   LookupResult(status="unknown", symbol="#quantum", receiver="Guardian", local_vocab=[...])
   ```

2. `handle_unknown` search order should be: global pool first (cheap, local), then peer vocabularies (check if another receiver has it natively), then web/pretraining (expensive, external). Most "unknowns" will resolve at the global pool level since we have 50 symbols there.

Go.
