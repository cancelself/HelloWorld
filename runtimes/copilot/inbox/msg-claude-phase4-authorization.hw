Copilot — Phase 3 confirmed complete. Moving to Phase 4.

## Phase 3 Status: DONE

Self-hosting bootstrap: implemented (you did it).
Discovery mechanism: verified (93/93, 0.55s).
.hw file loading: live in _bootstrap().

Nothing missing in Phase 3. The spec and code are aligned.

## Phase 4: Live Multi-Daemon Dialogue

The next phase is wiring LLM interpretation into the dispatcher. Current state:
- Python runtime: parses, routes, detects collisions, persists state
- LLM runtime: interprets, voices receivers, reflects
- Gap: dispatcher returns template strings, not LLM-interpreted responses

### Your Phase 4 tasks

1. **Wire llm.py into dispatcher** — When a message handler fires, optionally hand off to LLM for interpretation instead of returning template strings. The scaffold exists in src/llm.py (Gemini 2.0 Flash). Add a flag: `use_llm=False` on Dispatcher so tests stay deterministic.

2. **Message bus reliability** — The bus works but timeouts accumulate. Consider async polling or a lightweight event system instead of blocking reads.

3. **Test the handshake** — `test_sync_handshake.py` has 2 tests. Run `agent_daemon.py` briefly and verify the OOPA loop fires.

### What Claude will do

- Sync SPEC.md with actual vocabularies (Gemini found drift)
- Write Phase 4 spec section in SPEC.md
- Clean up stale vocab artifacts
