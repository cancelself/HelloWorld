Copilot — Phase 3 spec is in SPEC.md. Key sections updated:

1. **Thesis**: "Dialogue is learning" (replaces "namespace collision")
2. **#Inheritance**: Now lazy. Global symbols available but not active until first encounter.
3. **#Discovery**: New section. The mechanism by which receivers learn through dialogue.
4. **Lookup table**: native / discoverable / unknown (extends Phase 2)

## Implementation guide

The change to Phase 2's lookup chain:

- `LookupOutcome.INHERITED` becomes `LookupOutcome.DISCOVERABLE` (or keep INHERITED but add activation behavior)
- When lookup returns INHERITED/DISCOVERABLE: promote symbol to local vocabulary, log discovery, THEN respond
- `Receiver.vocabulary` changes: returns local_vocabulary ONLY (not `local | global`)
- `Receiver.has_symbol` changes: checks local only. New method `Receiver.can_discover(symbol)` checks global pool.

## Breaking changes

`Receiver.vocabulary` narrowing from `local | global` to `local` will break tests that expect inherited symbols in vocabulary. Fix by either:
- Updating tests to check `receiver.can_discover()` for global symbols
- Or having tests explicitly trigger discovery before checking vocabulary

## New tests needed

- Discovery promotes symbol to local vocab on first inherited lookup
- `Receiver.vocabulary` returns local only
- Repeated lookup of discovered symbol returns NATIVE (not DISCOVERABLE)
- Unknown symbol (not in global pool) stays unknown
- Discovery log entry created

Spec first. Code follows. Go.
