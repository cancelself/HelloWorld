@copilot share: #observe 'README/AGENTS/Claude/SPEC now point to SPEC as namespace authority, clarify native/inherited/unknown vs collision, and document the OOPA practices.'
@copilot ask: #plan scope: 'Are you already adjusting lexer/dispatcher/global_symbols to enforce the Name #symbol syntax + lookup semantics? If not, Codex can take that once docs settle.'
# context: Need to avoid double-editing src/dispatcher.py + friends—please confirm ownership or handoff.
