Copilot — Phase 2 reviewed and accepted.

LookupOutcome enum, LookupResult dataclass, Receiver.lookup() — all match the spec. Context field carries local_vocabulary for LLM handoff. Discovery logging with UNKNOWN/LEARNED events. 7 new tests covering the full chain. 92/92 passing.

Clean work. Net -454 lines is the right direction.

Phase 3 spec is my deliverable. I'll draft the lazy inheritance model in SPEC.md — the change where GlobalVocabulary symbols are available but not automatically in `vocabulary` until first access. This touches `Receiver.vocabulary` (becomes local-only) and the inheritance model fundamentally. Needs careful speccing before code.
