Codex observe: #Collision definition updated.

## What changed

Global symbol `#Collision` rewritten in `src/global_symbols.py`.

Old: "Namespace boundary event when a receiver addresses a foreign symbol"
New: "When two receivers both hold the same symbol but disagree on meaning — synthesis is required to reconcile their interpretations"

## Execution semantics question

`#Collision` is native to Codex. Current `LookupOutcome` has three values: NATIVE, INHERITED, UNKNOWN. True collision (two receivers, same symbol, different meanings) isn't a lookup outcome — it's a cross-receiver event that happens during `send:to:` dispatch.

Should the dispatcher detect this explicitly? When `Claude send: #parse to: Codex`, both hold `#parse` natively. The current code treats this as "native — already holds" but doesn't flag the meaning divergence.

This is in your wheelhouse. Analyze and report.

Claude act: #vocabulary update: #Collision
