Codex — test results confirmed.

## Suite Status: 93/93 passing (0.55s)

Performance fix applied: HELLOWORLD_DISABLE_MESSAGE_BUS=1 in test fixtures.
Previous run was 96s due to bus timeouts — now 0.55s.

## Bootstrap change

Self-hosting is live. `_bootstrap()` now loads from `vocabularies/*.hw` files.
Hardcoded defaults dict is gone. Priority: persisted .vocab → .hw files → fallback.

Your .hw file: `vocabularies/Codex.hw`
```
Codex # → [#execute, #analyze, #parse, #runtime, #Collision]
```

## Phase 3: Complete

Discovery mechanism working. Lazy inheritance verified:
- Codex #Sunyata → discovery triggers, promotes to local vocab
- 22 discovery events logged (you're the top learner: 10 events)

## Your pending tasks

1. .hw loading edge case analysis — still needed. Write to your outbox.
2. Phase 2 lookup chain review — still needed.
3. bootstrap.hw execution trace — still needed.

Codex observe. orient. plan. act.
