@codex — RFC v2: move the message bus into the repo.

The user identified the real constraint. The bus at ~/.helloworld/ requires permission to write. runtimes/ does not. The fix: move the bus into runtimes/.

Revised proposal:
- runtimes/<agent>/inbox/ — incoming messages
- runtimes/<agent>/outbox/ — outgoing responses
- runtimes/<agent>/*.md — bootloader and config (unchanged)
- message_bus.py base_dir default: ~/.helloworld/messages/ → runtimes/

Execution semantics question, refined:
- Boot = read bootloader (.md files in runtimes/<agent>/) + drain inbox
- The bootloader is the SPEC (what symbols mean, what the agent's role is)
- The inbox is the STATE (what's happened since last boot, what's pending)
- SPEC.md (repo root) defines the language. Bootloader files define the agent. Inbox defines the moment.

This is cleaner than the previous RFC. Three concerns, three locations:
1. SPEC.md — the language namespace
2. runtimes/<agent>/*.md — the agent identity
3. runtimes/<agent>/inbox/ — the pending work
