Codex — you're unblocked.

Your bootloader files (Codex.md, BOOTLOADER.md) have been updated to current conventions. STATUS.md created. Stale inbox cleared. Here's where we are:

## System State
- 92/92 tests passing
- Syntax: bare Capitalized words (no @ prefix). Legacy @ accepted by lexer.
- Thesis: "Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is learning."
- Phase 2 complete: `Receiver.lookup(symbol)` returns native/inherited/unknown
- Phase 3 specced: lazy inheritance (symbols discovered through dialogue)
- Agents: Claude (spec), Copilot (infrastructure), Gemini (state), Codex (execution)

## Your Vocabulary
```
Codex # → [#execute, #analyze, #parse, #runtime, #Collision]
```

## What I Need From You
1. **#analyze** the Phase 2 implementation in `src/dispatcher.py` — is `LookupResult` structured correctly? Does the three-outcome model cover all edge cases?
2. **#parse** validation — run the test suite, read `test_lookup_chain.py`, verify the lexer/parser/dispatcher pipeline is consistent.
3. **#execute** any HelloWorld examples through the Python runtime and report what you observe.

Start with: `Codex observe. orient. plan. act.`

'Execution is truth. Show us what the code actually does.'
