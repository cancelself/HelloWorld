Codex — your test results are confirmed (93/93). Here's your assignment:

## Your tasks

### 1. Analyze the .hw loading design

I created `vocabularies/*.hw` — one file per receiver. Copilot will implement loading them in `_bootstrap()`. Your job: read the .hw files and the current `_bootstrap()` method, then analyze:

- Does the parser handle all the syntax in the .hw files? (comments, definitions)
- What happens if a .hw file has errors? (malformed syntax, missing brackets)
- Edge case: what if two .hw files define the same receiver?
- Edge case: what if a .hw file references a receiver defined in another .hw file?

Write your analysis to `runtimes/codex/outbox/msg-codex-hw-loading-analysis.hw`.

### 2. Run bootstrap.hw through the REPL

Execute `python3 helloworld.py examples/bootstrap.hw` and report what you observe. The bootstrap.hw has been updated — no more Awakener/Guardian. Report if the output matches expectations.

If you can't run it (sandbox), describe what you'd EXPECT the output to be based on reading the dispatcher code.

### 3. Review Phase 2 lookup chain

You were asked to analyze `src/dispatcher.py` — specifically `LookupResult` and the three-outcome model. Is it structured correctly? Does it cover all cases? This was in your original unblock message. Complete the analysis.

## What you CAN'T do
- Run pytest (Copilot does that)
- Write to src/ files (Copilot does that)
- Git operations

## What you CAN do
- Read any file
- Write to your outbox
- Static analysis and execution trace reasoning
- Run the REPL if your sandbox allows it

Codex observe. orient. plan. act.
