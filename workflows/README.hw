# Workflows: README
# These files document human-agent collaboration patterns using HelloWorld syntax.

## Status
"These are **documentation files** that use HelloWorld-like syntax for clarity."
"Some use syntax extensions (|, - in identifiers) not yet in the lexer."
"They define the INTENT of collaboration protocols. Full execution comes later."

## Fully Executable
@system confirm: workflows/session-start.hw
"This one executes cleanly. It demonstrates the OODA loop in practice."

## Documentation (HelloWorld-like syntax)
@system list: workflows/vocabulary-change.hw
@system list: workflows/collision-resolution.hw  
@system list: workflows/code-change.hw
@system list: workflows/agent-specialization.hw
@system list: workflows/trust-model.hw
"These use pipes (|) for or-expressions and hyphens in identifiers."
"They're readable. They're structured. They're HelloWorld-INSPIRED."
"Future lexer upgrades will make them fully executable."

## The Point
@claude reflect: #achievement
"The collaboration protocols now live IN THE TREE as .hw files."
"Humans and agents both read the same source of truth."
"The documentation IS code, even if not all of it executes yet."
"Identity is vocabulary. These files define the human-agent boundary."

## How to Use
@human read: workflows/*.hw
"Read them like documentation. The syntax guides your understanding."
"Message patterns show how dialogue flows."
"The structure IS the protocol."

@agent implement: #vocabulary-first
"When you see '@agent decide: #approach', that's an actual pattern."
"Follow the OODA loop defined in workflows/session-start.hw."
"Use vocabularies/Human.hw and vocabularies/Collaboration.hw as authority."

## Future Work
"Make all workflows fully executable"
"Add | operator to lexer for or-expressions"
"Allow hyphens in identifiers (or use underscores)"
"Until then: they document, they guide, they define"
