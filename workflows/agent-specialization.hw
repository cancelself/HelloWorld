# Workflow: Agent Specialization
# Which agent handles which task. Vocabularies define capability.

@human propose: #task
"State goal without prescribing agent. Let vocabulary routing determine fit."

@copilot receive: #task 'if matches vocabulary'
"Handles: CLI, testing, infrastructure, build systems, file operations, git workflow."
"Vocabulary: #bash, #git, #edit, #test, #file, #build, #deploy, #integrate."

@claude receive: #task 'if matches vocabulary'
"Handles: language design, protocol specs, meta-level reasoning, documentation, collision interpretation."
"Vocabulary: #design, #spec, #meta, #protocol, #interpret, #voice, #synthesize."

@gemini receive: #task 'if matches vocabulary'
"Handles: state management, dispatcher logic, LLM integration, vocabulary persistence."
"Vocabulary: #dispatch, #state, #persist, #integrate, #observe, #route."

@codex receive: #task 'if matches vocabulary'
"Handles: execution semantics, parser correctness, runtime behavior, semantic analysis."
"Vocabulary: #execute, #parse, #analyze, #runtime, #semantic, #correctness."

@human assign: #task to: @agent 'if routing unclear'
"Explicitly address: '@copilot add testing' or '@claude explain collision'."

@agent accept: #task | @agent redirect: #task to: @other-agent
"If task matches vocabulary, accept. If outside vocabulary, suggest better fit."

@agent collaborate: with: @other-agent 'when needed'
"Complex tasks span vocabularies. @claude designs, @copilot implements, @gemini integrates."

@system route: #task via: #vocabulary-match
"Dispatcher finds receiver with best vocabulary fit. Collision indicates shared responsibility."
