# Index: HelloWorld Collaboration Protocols
# The complete map of human-agent collaboration vocabulary

## Core Receivers
@HelloWorld # → vocabularies/HelloWorld.hw
"Root receiver. Defines: #send, #receive, #become, #Sunyata, #Smalltalk"

@Agent # → vocabularies/Agent.hw  
"Agent protocol. Defines: #observe, #orient, #decide, #act, #reflect, #unknown"

@Human # → vocabularies/Human.hw
"Human receiver. Defines: #propose, #review, #approve, #question, #guide, #collaborate, #trust, #boundary"

@Collaboration # → vocabularies/Collaboration.hw
"Collaboration protocol. Defines: #vocabulary-first, #test-confirmed, #collision-aware, #ooda-report, #minimal-change"

## Agent Specialization
@copilot # → vocabularies/Copilot.hw
"Infrastructure, testing, CLI. Vocabulary: #bash, #git, #edit, #test"

@claude # → vocabularies/Claude.hw
"Design, specs, meta-reasoning. Vocabulary: #design, #spec, #meta, #interpret"

@gemini # → vocabularies/Gemini.hw
"State, dispatch, persistence. Vocabulary: #dispatch, #state, #persist"

@codex # → vocabularies/Codex.hw
"Execution, parsing, semantics. Vocabulary: #execute, #parse, #analyze"

## Workflows (Executable Protocols)
@system query: workflows/session-start.hw
"Pattern: How sessions begin. OODA loop in practice."

@system query: workflows/vocabulary-change.hw
"Pattern: Identity evolution. Adding symbols to receivers."

@system query: workflows/collision-resolution.hw
"Pattern: Handling namespace collisions. When meanings conflict."

@system query: workflows/code-change.hw
"Pattern: Implementation workflow. Vocabulary → code → tests."

@system query: workflows/agent-specialization.hw
"Pattern: Task routing by vocabulary fit. Who handles what."

@system query: workflows/trust-model.hw
"Pattern: Autonomy boundaries. What humans trust vs verify."

## How to Read This Tree
@human start: session
"1. Read workflows/session-start.hw to see how we begin"
"2. Check vocabularies/Human.hw for your receiver vocabulary"  
"3. Check vocabularies/Collaboration.hw for protocol symbols"
"4. Use workflows/*.hw as templates for common patterns"

@agent start: task
"1. Observe: Read the request, check vocabularies"
"2. Orient: Does this match my vocabulary? Need collaboration?"
"3. Decide: State approach clearly, reference workflow pattern"
"4. Act: Execute, following vocabulary-first principle"
"5. Reflect: Report results, test status, vocabulary changes"

## The Principle
@HelloWorld state: #thesis
"Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision."
"Documentation is executable code. Protocols are HelloWorld programs."
"The tree practices what it preaches. Read the .hw files."

## Stats
'8 vocabulary files'
'6 workflow files'  
'307 lines of HelloWorld collaboration protocol'
'352/352 tests passing'
'Zero Markdown documentation of collaboration patterns'
'All protocols are now executable HelloWorld code'
