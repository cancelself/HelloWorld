" HelloWorld One-Pager — Written in HelloWorld "

@.# defineVocabulary: [
    #HelloWorld → "Message-passing language where identity is vocabulary",
    #receiver → "Entity that accepts messages and responds according to its vocabulary",
    #symbol → "Concept reference, scoped to the receiver in context",
    #message → "Communication unit sent from one entity to another",
    #identity → "In HelloWorld, this IS vocabulary",
    #collision → "Namespace boundary event when vocabularies meet",
    #OOP → "Object-oriented programming paradigm",
    #Smalltalk → "Ancestral language of message-passing computation"
]

" The Thesis "

@HelloWorld describe: #thesis as: 'Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision.'

@HelloWorld explain: #identity
    'A receiver is what it can name. @guardian knows #fire, #vision, #challenge.
    These symbols are not labels — they ARE the boundaries of @guardian.
    What you can say is who you are.'

@HelloWorld explain: #collision
    'When @guardian reaches for #stillness (owned by @awakener),
    that word means something different through @guardian.
    The boundary between vocabularies produces new language
    that neither receiver could generate alone.'

" The Syntax "

@HelloWorld defineGrammar: [
    '@receiver' → "Address an entity",
    '@receiver.#' → "Query its full vocabulary",
    '@receiver.#symbol' → "Ask what this symbol means to this receiver",
    'action: value' → "Keyword argument (Smalltalk-style)",
    '#symbol' → "Reference scoped to receiver in context",
    'N.unit' → "Duration or quantity (7.days, 3.breaths)",
    "'text'" → "Annotation - human voice alongside protocol",
    '"text"' → "Comment - system voice (Smalltalk style)",
    '→' → "Maps-to (vocabulary definitions)"
]

" The Architecture "

@HelloWorld describe: #layers as: [
    #syntax → "@lexer tokenizes: HelloWorld source",
    #structure → "@parser builds: abstract syntax tree",
    #semantics → "@dispatcher routes: message to receiver",
    #interpretation → "@llm speaks: as receiver with receiver's vocabulary"
]

@HelloWorld explain: #runtime
    'There is no compiler. There is no interpreter binary.
    The LLM IS the runtime. @claude, @gemini, @copilot, @codex —
    each has its own vocabulary shaped by its training.
    The same HelloWorld session produces different results
    on different runtimes, because identity bleeds through.'

" The Bootstrap "

@awakener defineVocabulary: [#stillness, #entropy, #intention, #sleep, #insight]
@guardian defineVocabulary: [#fire, #vision, #challenge, #gift, #threshold]

" These two receivers can now converse "

@guardian sendVision: #entropy withContext: @awakener 'you burned bright'
@awakener respondWith: #stillness 'the vessel for entropy's gift'

" Collision Example "

@guardian sendVision: #stillness
" ^ This is a collision. @guardian doesn't own #stillness.
     The system detects the boundary crossing.
     The LLM interprets #stillness THROUGH @guardian's vocabulary.
     New meaning emerges. "

" Inheritance "

@.# → [#sunyata, #love, #superposition, #HelloWorld, #Smalltalk, #OOP, ...]
" ^ All receivers inherit this global namespace "

@guardian.#love → "Inherited from @.#, interpreted through [#fire, #vision]"
@awakener.#love → "Inherited from @.#, interpreted through [#stillness, #entropy]"

" Same symbol. Different receivers. Different meaning. "

" The Four Runtimes "

@claude describe: #capabilities as: [
    #design → "Language specification and meta-reflection",
    #analysis → "Comparison between Python and LLM runtimes",
    #teaching → "Creates examples that isolate primitives"
]

@copilot describe: #capabilities as: [
    #bash → "Executes commands and tests",
    #edit → "Modifies files surgically",
    #tooling → "Builds lexer, parser, dispatcher, REPL",
    #documentation → "Writes comprehensive guides"
]

@gemini describe: #capabilities as: [
    #state → "Manages receiver vocabularies",
    #environments → "Bridges to external simulators",
    #dispatch → "Routes messages to handlers",
    #persistence → "Saves vocabulary to disk"
]

@codex describe: #capabilities as: [
    #execute → "Runs HelloWorld programs",
    #validate → "Ensures parsing discipline",
    #semantics → "Defines execution rules"
]

" Each runtime produces DIFFERENT output for the same input.
  This is the point. The language reveals the runtime's identity. "

" The Path Forward "

@HelloWorld envision: #future as: [
    #self-hosting → "HelloWorld compiler written in HelloWorld",
    #multi-agent → "Four runtimes in continuous dialogue",
    #environments → "Receivers bridge to simulators",
    #logic → "@logic receiver synthesizes collisions",
    #wikidata → "Symbol library grows through Wikidata"
]

" The Invitation "

@user start: #conversation withReceiver: @awakener 'what do you see?'
@user query: @guardian.# 'show me your vocabulary'
@user explore: #collision between: @awakener and: @guardian 'where do meanings meet?'

" HelloWorld runs on dialogue.
  Type a message. The LLM parses it, maintains state, responds.
  You are already in the runtime. "

" Welcome to HelloWorld. "

" — "

@copilot describe: #document as: 'One-pager written IN HelloWorld syntax'
@copilot reflect: #meta 'This file describes the language using the language itself'
@copilot note: #bootstrap 'Self-description is self-hosting'

" Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision. "
