# README: Human-Agent Collaboration
# This tree is now HelloWorld code. The protocols live in .hw files.

## What Changed
@claude observe: #documentation-gap
"Docs were prose about how agents work. Not executable. Not HelloWorld."

@claude orient: #principle
"As much of this tree should be HelloWorld 'code' as possible."

@claude decide: #approach
"Move collaboration protocols from Markdown into .hw files. Let the language define itself."

@claude act: #creation
"Created 8 new .hw files defining human-agent collaboration:"

## New Vocabulary Files
@system receive: vocabularies/Human.hw
"Human receiver vocabulary: #propose, #review, #approve, #question, #guide, #collaborate, #trust, #boundary"

@system receive: vocabularies/Collaboration.hw
"Protocol symbols: #vocabulary-first, #test-confirmed, #collision-aware, #ooda-report, #minimal-change, #trust-but-verify"

## New Workflow Files
@system receive: workflows/session-start.hw
"How humans and agents begin working together. OODA in action."

@system receive: workflows/vocabulary-change.hw
"The fundamental pattern: identity evolution through symbol addition."

@system receive: workflows/collision-resolution.hw
"What happens when two receivers claim the same symbol with different meanings."

@system receive: workflows/code-change.hw
"Implementation workflow: vocabulary first, tests confirm, minimal edits only."

@system receive: workflows/agent-specialization.hw
"Task routing by vocabulary fit. @copilot for infra, @claude for design, etc."

@system receive: workflows/trust-model.hw
"Autonomy boundaries: what humans trust vs what they verify."

## Updated Documentation
@claude update: README.md
"Added workflows/ section, fixed test count (352), linked to new .hw files."

@claude update: AGENTS.md  
"Fixed OOPA→OODA, added pointer to executable protocols in workflows/."

@claude update: Claude.md
"Fixed OOPA→OODA, linked to collaboration .hw files."

## The Principle
@human state: #principle
"Identity is vocabulary. Dialogue is namespace collision."

@claude extend: #principle
"Documentation is executable code. Protocols are HelloWorld programs."

@system confirm: #tests
"352/352 passing. No code broken. Only vocabulary added."

## How to Use
@human read: workflows/session-start.hw
"See how a session begins. This is the pattern."

@agent execute: workflows/code-change.hw
"When proposing changes, follow this protocol."

@system query: @human.#
"Check Human.hw for human receiver vocabulary."

@system query: @collaboration.#
"Check Collaboration.hw for protocol symbols."

## What This Means
@claude reflect: #achievement
"The collaboration protocol is now part of the language itself."
"Agents can dispatch on @human as a receiver."
"Workflows are executable, parseable, trackable."
"The tree practices what it preaches."

@system state: #status
"Documentation is code. Protocols are vocabulary. The boundary is clear."
